        <p>As my student, you should know that I am not perfect. Moreover, you should know that <em>I</em> know that I&#8217;m not perfect. We&#8217;re going to be working together for a while; I want you to know what you&#8217;re getting&nbsp;into.</p>
<p>Here are some things that I suck&nbsp;at.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Remembering.</em> Really: I don&#8217;t remember <em>anything.</em> If you talked to me about it half an hour ago, there&#8217;s a decent chance I&#8217;ve already forgotten it. I don&#8217;t mean to; it&#8217;s just the truth of me. If you need me to remember something, or to do something for you, <em>email me.</em> Just talking to me will do pretty much no&nbsp;good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Planning ahead.</em> I am writing this on July 11, 2012, and by my standards, that&#8217;s an <em>absurd</em> amount of foresight for a Fall semester. Whether with my classes or with my life, I am generally no good at planning ahead. Sometimes this is because I&#8217;ve let time get away from me (see below), but a lot of the time&#8212;at least in the context of my classes&#8212;it&#8217;s because what I&#8217;m doing on any given day is determined by what&#8217;s happened in class in the days&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The upshot for anyone more future-oriented than myself, though, is that if you ask me a question like &#8220;What are we doing in class next Friday,&#8221; I probably can&#8217;t answer, because it likely depends rather a lot on what happens in class next&nbsp;Wednesday. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Estimating time.</em> <strong><span class="caps">OH</span> <span class="caps">MAN</span></strong> do I suck at this. I suck at this <em>so</em>&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>This morning my wife and I were talking about <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/jobs">a job posting</a> that the reliably awesome folks at <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry</a> have posted, and I said, &#8220;I kinda want to apply for&nbsp;that.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a full time job.&#8221; (I already have a full time job, of&nbsp;course.)</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can&#8217;t do it full time, sure, but maybe I could do it full time during the Summer, and half time during the school&nbsp;year.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Do you think you have twenty extra hours a week during the&nbsp;semester?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, until she said it like that, I did. I&#8217;m just <em>awful</em> both at judging how long things will take and at judging how much time I have to do&nbsp;the.</p>
<p>For this reason, in class, I try never to say things like &#8220;I will have X ready by Y,&#8221; because one or both of those problems will likely make me wrong. I will usually say &#8220;I <em>should</em> have X by Y,&#8221; which leaves me a little room to be&nbsp;wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tackling things piecemeal.</em> Let&#8217;s say today is Monday, and I have 50 student papers that were just turned in, and I want them to be back in student hands by Friday. What a normal person would do is try to tackle 10 papers a day, so that by the end of the day Friday, they&#8217;re done. Yay!&nbsp;Reasonable.</p>
<p>I will probably not do this. Instead, I will try to orchestrate things so that I have an enormous block of time so that I can do them all at once. This may or may not work, and because it&#8217;s harder to get ten hours or so at a block than it is to get two hours together five times, it&#8217;ll likely end up meaning that I don&#8217;t accomplish things according to my own&nbsp;deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Prioritizing.</em> Broadly speaking, I have no idea what is important and what is not. If I have five tasks I need to complete, I have a lot of trouble deciding which I should approach first, even if one of them is &#8220;exit the burning building.&#8221;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Being mean.</em> This is a tough one. As a teacher, sometimes it&#8217;s my job to be mean. I&#8217;m good at that when it matters. If you need to fail my class, you need to fail my class&#8212;and while that sucks for everybody, you&#8217;re not going to be able to sweet-talk me out of&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>The times when I suck at being mean, though, are the little times. I set out my policies pretty clearly on my Syllabi, and I hold to those policies pretty clearly. So when someone comes to me and says, for example, &#8220;I need to leave 45 minutes early today,&#8221; I&#8217;ll likely say &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and mean&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that what the student hears is something like, &#8220;Oh, of course visiting your out-of-state stylist for an elaborate purple up-do is more important than my class; by all means, come and go as you please and expect no consequences whatsoever.!&#8221; When what I mean is &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s your choice; as per the Syllabus, I&#8217;ll be marking you absent.&nbsp;Ta!&#8221;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all things I&#8217;m trying to get better at, but they&#8217;re also things that I struggle with as a teacher, and I think the better you understand my limitations and my strengths, the greater the likelyhood that you&#8217;ll succeed in my class. I will work on these things. You should know that I&#8217;m working on&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>The thing that initially prompted me to consider the possibility that I had <span class="caps">ADD</span> was when, in the middle of writing a sentence, I stopped because I had to clip my toenails. <em>Had to,</em> right then. Nothing had changed about my toenails, mind, nor were they in particularly bad condition. The two tasks just seemed equally relevant at the time.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
