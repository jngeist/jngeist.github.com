                &lt;p&gt;((Because at its worst, what we mean when we say &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want to put labels on people&amp;#8221; is &amp;#8220;I haven&amp;#8217;t actually stopped dating my ex.&amp;#8221;)) It&amp;#8217;s a relationship cliche that &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t want to put a label on this&amp;#8221; is just another way of saying &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m unwilling to commit,&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m excluding myself from this label because I want the benefits it implies, but not the obligations.&amp;#8221; When we refuse to add labels to who we are, we&amp;#8217;re refusing to recognize any commonality&amp;#8212;or at least, any nameable commonality&amp;#8212;with anyone. When my son calls me &amp;#8220;Dad,&amp;#8221; he labels me. To deny the label is to deny something essential about who we are to one&amp;nbsp;another.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;Come with me this far, at least: &lt;em&gt;March Fadness&lt;/em&gt; is in truth an essay made of essays, a great metaekphrasis[^1] using art and memory to heighten and sharpen one another&amp;#8217;s mystery. ((&lt;em&gt;March Fadness&lt;/em&gt; is rooted in a belief that art&amp;#8212;even the one-hit wonders of the 90s&amp;#8212;offers access to&amp;nbsp;humanity.))&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These votes are immensely complex; if two of us vote for the same song, can we say with any certainty that those two votes mean the same thing? We cannot. Are people voting for the songs? For the videos? For the memories? For the essays? For the essayists? For the preservation of their own brackets? Or &lt;em&gt;against&lt;/em&gt; any of those things, as I always root for whoever the Jets are playing?[^2] Or do all these strands braid around the maypole of a single radio button? Can we have a meaningful conversation about &amp;#8220;which song is the best&amp;#8221; if we are not in communion about what purpose art&amp;nbsp;serves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last question is why Justin St. Germain&amp;#8212;and, by extension, &lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;OMC&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;How Bizarre&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;must be&amp;nbsp;stopped. &lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;Let me finally add that these calculations leave out the moral and emotional aspects of this process. Certainly, we can reduce microwaving to a question of mere efficiency, but this loses all of the complicated nuance of the task. How does one account for the feeling of pride one gets with a careful, accurate estimation? How does one factor in the way the food tastes just a little bit better knowing that its perfect temperature is the result of my own insight and forethought, rather than haphazard button-slapping? How too the knowledge that those who share the microwave with me will feel my respect and admiration manifested in a clean&amp;nbsp;timer?&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;How do you negotiate &amp;#8230; the conflicts/tensions between student purposes in their writing and the purposes we assume they have to learn about in academic&amp;nbsp;writing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Allow me to interrogate your slash. Does it stand for &amp;#8220;or?&amp;#8221; Does it stand for &lt;em&gt;beziehungsweise?&lt;/em&gt; Does it clarify? Tension is not always conflict. Think &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity&#34;&gt;tensegrity&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;http://static.panoramio.com/photos/large/62016957.jpg&#34;&gt;impossible things&lt;/a&gt; stand tall because their tension balances them. Tension is sometimes harmony, or at least tension can sometimes be&amp;nbsp;harmonized.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

&lt;p&gt;From time to time I get emails or twitter mentions from other people who also thought some of my web experiments at &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://killscreen.com/author/j-nicholas-geist/&#34;&gt;Kill Screen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; were neat, and wondering where they are. So (with &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;KS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s permission) I&amp;#8217;m republishing &lt;a href=&#34;/oddities/&#34;&gt;some of those oddities here&lt;/a&gt;. The first of them is one of my favorite things I&amp;#8217;ve ever written, my review of &lt;a href=&#34;/oddities/infinity-blade/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Infinity Blade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

                &lt;p&gt;I was listening to a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.maximumfun.org/bullseye/judge-john-hodgman-episode-151-sic-semper-dramatis&#34;&gt;not-very-recent episode of &lt;em&gt;Judge John Hodgman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently where Judge Hodgman, Bailiff Jesse, and an unspeakably fabulous man debated the equivalence of reading and listening to audiobooks, and ever since I&amp;#8217;ve been paying much more attention to the different dynamics of the experiences. Having just made it through Spring Break, and as a regular commuter, I&amp;#8217;ve been doing a lot of both, and my feeling&amp;#8212;somewhat surprisingly&amp;#8212;is that Judge Hodgman was right: they are &amp;#8220;separate but equal&amp;#8221; experiences. A book and its audiobook offer two fundamentally different ways to experience the story they&amp;nbsp;describe.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;As a teacher, I &lt;a href=&#34;http://inthecourseofmyduties.tumblr.com&#34;&gt;comment&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of student writing. I usually do this digitally, as my handwriting is so awful as to make doctors weep. And, because students in the same classes tend to be learning the same things at the same time, I often find myself needing to say the same thing over and over, to lots of students in lots of different&amp;nbsp;classes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I need to be able to inject these comments quickly, easily, and repeatedly, I&amp;#8217;ve been trying to find a good way to automate them for some time now. In my last attempt, I&amp;#8217;ve figured out a pretty good way to do this—solving a long-standing problem I&amp;#8217;ve had with Keyboard Maestro in the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

            <content type="html">
                
                &lt;p&gt;Iteration is important. One of the most elegant things about the difference between, say, &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 2&lt;/em&gt; is the way in which the combat system builds on what has come before. On the one hand, &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ME2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; feels like &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ME&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; On the other, it&amp;#8217;s streamlined. Simpler. More elegant. And what speaks most highly for it, I think, is that I feel like playing &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ME2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; made me better understand what combat in &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;caps&#34;&gt;ME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to&amp;nbsp;be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I recognize that games that come in series are &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to iterate. But having just finished &lt;em&gt;Assassin&amp;#8217;s Creed: Revelations,&lt;/em&gt; I&amp;#8217;m starting to remember the &lt;em&gt;dangers&lt;/em&gt; of&amp;nbsp;iteration.&lt;/p&gt;            </content>

                &lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;/categories/geek&#34;&gt;fiddle around with a lot of things.&lt;/a&gt;  It&amp;#8217;s in my nature. I began listing my recent forays into configuring email as an example, and I realized quite quickly that the odyssey ought to be its own post. The reason I do this sort of fiddling, though, almost always composed of two intertwining mental&amp;nbsp;phenomena:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know what I need,&amp;nbsp;and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I know the limitations of the thing I&amp;#8217;m fiddling&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, when we&amp;#8217;re talking about software or something similar, I know up front what the limitations are; often, though, I only find out by playing around with it. Likewise, I often know what I need up front; other times, though, I only find out what I need by finding out where my needs rub up against the limitations of whatever it is I&amp;#8217;m trying to work&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I was listening to &lt;a href=&#34;http://5by5.tv/b2w/71&#34;&gt;Back to Work 71&lt;/a&gt;, I started thinking about the problems that exist in organizations&amp;#8212;things like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://passiveaggressivenotes.com/&#34;&gt;passive aggression&lt;/a&gt; that Merlin and Dan were discussing&amp;#8212;as functions of that same pair of forces. More specifically, it made me think about the problems I have as a teacher with my students, the problems my students have with me as a teacher, and perhaps most importantly, the problems I have with myself as a teacher.  ((All these problems&amp;#8212;and perhaps all problems&amp;#8212;come down to a conflict between one party&amp;#8217;s expectations and another party&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;limitations.))&lt;/p&gt;            </content>
