        <p>I feel compelled to comment on this <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beatonna/status/28848973254">series</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beatonna/status/28848979918">of</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beatonna/status/28848985491">tweets</a> from Kate
Beaton (utterly fantastic <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/">webcomic</a> artist and one of my favorite
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/beatonna/">tweeters</a>), and on <a href="http://regreteverything.tumblr.com/post/1412408265">this tumbld response</a> from a reader,<sup id="fnref:a"><a href="#fn:a" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>  because I
think I feel like the latter is missing a key point about feminism that is
worth elaborating on.  It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s easy to forget when thinking
about feminism, and even when thinking as an aspiring feminist: even if men
and women are equal in every form of capability, men and women are not the
same, because they have different&nbsp;histories.</p>
<p>To save you the trouble of parsing 140 characters of sentiment at a time,
here&#8217;s what Beaton&nbsp;said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when you tell a female creator you like her work so much you want to marry
her and have her babies, you’re not doing anyone any favors<br />
</p>
<p>first of all, as cute as it sounds in your head, it’s a shitty, disrespectful
‘compliment.’ No one makes comics looking for sexual attention<br />
</p>
<p>secondly, by doing so you invite others to critique that person’s works based 
on their looks, which is uncomfortable, sexist and&nbsp;unfair.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first read the response over at <em>Regret Everything</em>, I was empathetic
to the writer&#8217;s position, because it&#8217;s something I might have thought myself
not too long ago.  The blogger, who identifies himself elsewhere as Anthony,
writes that a comment like that &#8220;is not being made based on the person’s
appearance,&#8221; but is &#8220;a message of appreciation and adoration&#8221; made &#8220;regardless
of age or gender.&#8221;  This last, I think, is exactly the point.  Anthony goes on
to say that he might say the same thing to a man, and obviously that would be
okay, and so asks, &#8220;Is it only offensive if the recipient of the statement is
a&nbsp;woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>To which question the answer is&nbsp;yes.</p>
<p>Because here&#8217;s what Anthony is missing: <em>Kate Beaton has a gender.</em><sup id="fnref:b"><a href="#fn:b" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> Kate
Beaton is a woman.  And, in terms of history and background, there&#8217;s a
significant difference between men and women, and that difference affects what
things mean, even if we don&#8217;t want it&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>Most folks who know me have probably encountered the fact that I am more or
less giddy in love with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0277213/">Nathan</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Fillion">Fillion</a>.  (<a href="http://www.hulu.com/firefly">Nathan</a> <a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/castle">Fillion</a><a href="http://twitter.com/#!/nathanfillion">
@nathanfillion</a> <a href="http://drhorrible.com/"><span class="caps">NATHAN</span></a> <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Caleb"><span class="caps">FILLION</span></a>.)  As with most geeks of my
type, I have similar feelings&#8212;though perhaps lesser in degree&#8212;for his Dr.
Horrible costar <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1260407/">Felic</a><a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1260407/">ia Day</a> (<a href="http://www.watchtheguild.com/">Felicia</a> <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Violet">Day</a>
<a href="http://twitter.com/feliciaday">@feliciaday</a><sup id="fnref:c"><a href="#fn:c" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>).  In fact, I will go so far as to say that one of the
most fulfilling parts of my life in the last week has been watching Veronica,
her character in Fallout: New Vegas, punch things.  (<span class="caps">VERONICA</span> <span class="caps">PUNCH</span>!)  Let&#8217;s
imagine that I met each of them, one day, and offered to marry them and have
their babies.<sup id="fnref:d"><a href="#fn:d" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
<p>Anthony is probably right: Fillion would probably take the comment in stride,
and be dashing and charming about it, as he is dashing and charming about
everything.  He may or may not perceive the comment as sexual in nature; if
so, he would probably perceive it as mock-sexual.  This is probably the first
significant flaw in Anthony&#8217;s argument.  Sex is a feature of marriage, and so
a marriage proposal is intrinsically a sexual advance, even if it is not based
on physical attractiveness.  Whether he perceived the advance as
representative of genuine sexual attraction, or as a joke, it wouldn&#8217;t much
matter, for a few reasons.  Fillion belongs to a group with a long history of
sexual agency, who for hundreds of years have been allowed to choose their own
mates, and who for hundreds of years have been perceived as valuable as
members of society, rather than as sexual objects.  This group is called&nbsp;&#8220;men.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine Day would respond in much the same way, laughing it off and making a
joke, but Day would have good reason to be made uncomfortable by the comment.
Women have a different history than men.  Historically and culturally, women
in the States have not had the same degree of freedom that men have.  Women
have not always been, and are not always now, seen as sexual agents.  (In
fact, 80% of victims of rape and sexual assault in the <span class="caps">US</span> in 2009 were
women.<sup id="fnref:e"><a href="#fn:e" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>) Women have not always been able to choose their mates, and
women for hundreds of years were perceived as valuable primarily as objects of
sexual (and nuptial) desire.  Which is to say, telling Felicia Day I want to
marry her means something different than telling Nathan Fillion I want to
marry&nbsp;him.</p>
<p>To use a different example: what if I said to each of them, &#8220;You should get
back in the kitchen where you belong?&#8221;  I&#8217;m saying the same thing, right?
Shouldn&#8217;t it therefore mean the same thing?  Of course it doesn&#8217;t, and neither
does &#8220;I want to have your&nbsp;babies.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the end, it&#8217;s not about Beaton&#8217;s insecurities, as Anthony suggests.  It&#8217;s
about a cultural history of discrimination and unequal treatment that means
that half of our population has both reason and right to assume that comments
about marriage are connected to sex, physical attractiveness, and
objectification, and that the other half doesn&#8217;t.  Just because you could say
it to a man, doesn&#8217;t mean you can say it to a woman.  And probably you
shouldn&#8217;t say it to&nbsp;either.</p>
