        <p><a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/10/lead_industry_lawyer_lays_out.php">This post</a> over at <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/">GameSetWatch</a> lays out some of the basic arguments we
can expect to hear from the <a href="http://www.entmerch.org/"><span class="caps">EMA</span></a> side of the table (i.e., in context, the
good guys). One of the &#8220;vagueness problems&#8221; Smith mentions is that the law in
question &#8220;limits restrictions to games that &#8216;as a whole &#8230; lack serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.&#8217;&#8221;<sup id="fnref:a1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:a1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>This is an epic assertion. Count &#8216;em, folks: there are four good reasons for a
videogame. <a href="http://jnicholasgeist.com/2010/07/08/art-and-attempt/">As I&#8217;ve blogged before</a>, there&#8217;s not even uniform agreement as to
whether games are capable of being artistic or literary, though my own views on
the matter are more certain.<sup id="fnref:a2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:a2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> To me, the problem extends well beyond
&#8220;vagueness.&#8221; Questions about &#8220;art&#8221; and gaming run into the same problems that
all questions about &#8220;art&#8221; do&#8212;problems of canon, which are problems of audience,
which are problems of race and&nbsp;class.</p>
<p>From the&nbsp;article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who’s to say, Smith asked, “that a video game about D-Day where everybody is
being shot at constantly&#8230; would have value, but a game about car theft in <span class="caps">L.A.
</span>doesn’t have value? &#8230; Is it because you can be an American soldier killing
Nazis in the D-Day game but you’re a ‘bad guy’ in the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> game?
&#8230; How do you decide which of those games has redeeming value?” Smith&#8217;s scare
quotes (which I&#8217;ll return to) notwithstanding, things are rather more
complicated than&nbsp;that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider a game set during the Detroit race riots. Or a game where the
protagonist is a Black Panther. Or a game where the main conflict is between
Hmong street gangs. Contrast with a game set during the American Revolution,
wherein the protagonist is shooting British Regulars, rather than regular&nbsp;Americans.</p>
<p>For the first three, we can&#8217;t count &#8220;political&#8221; value&#8212;the relevant parties are
extinct or nonexistent. We can probably safely dismiss &#8220;scientific&#8221; value. So
literary and artistic merit are the only ways we can get this game sold.
(Historical value, remember, doesn&#8217;t count. <span class="caps">NO</span> <span class="caps">HISTORY</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span>. Learn some other&nbsp;way.)</p>
<p>Historically speaking, the deciders of artistic and literary merit have been
white men. I see no reason to think that this problem will not affect video
games as much as anything else. I worry that the arbiters of merit for
videogames will be like that, as well, and see the Black Panther as a violent
participator in a violent revolt, and the early American as a revolutionary
patriot.<sup id="fnref:a3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:a3" rel="footnote">5</a></sup> The Hmong gang member, most likely, will receive credit for being
neither, just a violent&nbsp;thug.</p>
<p>I worry, too, even about games like <a href="http://www.heybabygame.com/info.php">Hey</a> <a href="http://jnicholasgeist.com/2010/10/06/i-like-your-bounce/">Baby</a>, which is clearly
political. &#8220;Certainly it&#8217;s political,&#8221; I can hear someone<sup id="fnref:a4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:a4" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> say, &#8220;but is it
<em>meritorious?</em>&#8221;</p>
<p>What Smith is either alluding to or avoiding with his comment about Nazis is
this: questions of what kind of violence are justified, which kinds are
acceptable, and which kinds are reprehensible, are decided by the moral
majority. That phrase has a particular (if lapsed) meaning in the States, and
its weight is no less heavy even with the loss of Jerry Falwell. As a result,
the question of what violence can be meritorious will be necessarily tied to the
reality of middle America, which is not the whole of reality, or even the whole
of American reality.<sup id="fnref:a5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:a5" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> This means that voices from other classes, races,
sexes, and experiences from the dominant will likely seem less meritorious to
the arbiters of value than those like their own&#8212;which means in turn that the
diversity of experiences we can share with our gaming younglings will be limited
to those not wholly unlike the ones they may ultimately&nbsp;have.</p>
<p>This, my friends and friendlies, is eminently crappy.<sup id="fnref:a6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:a6" rel="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<p>The only thing crappier is the fact that, by and large, we&#8217;re already <em>not</em>
