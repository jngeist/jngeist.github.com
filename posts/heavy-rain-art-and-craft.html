    <section class='content'>
        <p>Recently, I was fascinated by <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/">Brainy Gamer Michael Abbot&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2011/03/rollercoaster-bias.html">response</a> to
<em>Heavy Rain</em> designer David Cage&#8217;s talk at this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">GDC</span>.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Unlike Abbott, I
did like <em>Heavy Rain</em>, although at times I found its interface maddening, and I
felt like there were a lot of untapped possibilities in the story. The game was
rich, though, in what I value about gaming, which I have talked about at length
elsewhere in other games: empathy, shared subjectivity, difficult non-binary
choices, moral and ethical ambiguity, and origami.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>As I reflected on Abbott&#8217;s commentary on the session, I realized that part of
the reason I liked <em>Heavy Rain</em> is that it walks a difficult line, navigating a
very hard-to-find path through two different conceptual dichotomies, both of
which I explored in <a href="http://jnicholasgeist.com/2010/07/08/art-and-attempt/">the first post on this blog:</a> the tension between &#8220;art&#8221;
and &#8220;craft,&#8221; and the tension between ludic and fixed&nbsp;narratives.</p>
<p>In <a href="http://killscreenmagazine.com/articles/say-how-you-play">a recent article at <em>Kill Screen</em></a>, Jamin Warren&nbsp;proposes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of thinking about videogames as art, first let&#8217;s think about them as
objects. Specifically, let&#8217;s think about them as design objects. More
specifically, as things that we interact with both physically and digitally.
This seems immensely valuable to me. Consider the difference between a sculpture
(&#8220;art&#8221;) and a quilt (&#8220;craft&#8221;). A sculpture exists in a gallery, to be looked at,
and meaning is made by interpretation&#8212;that is, I look at it, and I attempt to
understand what the artist is trying to communicate. A quilt is no less a made
thing, and can be a thing of great beauty, but we recognize it as an object that
is made to a purpose, and we accept that its value comes from its interactivity:
we can do something with it.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Abbot has <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2011/03/pulling-their-weight.html">another piece</a> concerning the same session, and the interplay
between Cage&#8217;s ideas and those of Clint Hocking, who <a href="http://clicknothing.typepad.com/click_nothing/2007/10/ludonarrative-d.html">seems to be interested in
the same things I am,</a> generally speaking. In it, Abbott uses the phrase
&#8220;interactive storytelling&#8221; to describe the kind of games that Hocking and Cage
are striving toward (in very different ways). For me, though, &#8220;interactive
storytelling&#8221; seems self-contradictory. &#8220;Telling&#8221; is a transmissive mode of
communication, and as such it is unidirectional. Contrast with &#8220;discuss,&#8221;
&#8220;converse,&#8221; &#8220;dialog,&#8221; etc. What Hocking and Cage are describing, and what Cage
is working toward, is something more like collaborative story<em>making</em>, though
that sounds to my ears a little&nbsp;goofy.</p>
<p>This is what I feel is missing in Brian Moriaty&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ludix.com/moriarty/apology.html">explication</a> of the
tension between games and what he calls &#8220;sublime art.&#8221; I donâ€™t know if I care
whether games are &#8220;sublime art,&#8221; or even whether I believe that such a thing
exists. Moriarty asserts that the market pressures exerted on videogames mean
that nearly all games will be &#8220;kitsch&#8221; (according to his clearly articulated
definition), in the same way that nearly all films are &#8220;kitsch&#8221; by that same
definition. In order to qualify as sublime art, a text must innovate, must
interact with emotion in a way that is timeless, and must reward repeated
interaction with new experience and discovery. (I think.) Commercial art is
discouraged from doing these&nbsp;things.</p>
<p>However, Moriarty (and Ebert) acknowledge that some films can be art, despite
these same pressures. To me, it stands to reason that some games can be art
(even if we concede Moriartebert&#8217;s contention that none currently are). A game
like <em>Heavy Rain</em> can (and should) lead to discovery, in the way that Moriarty
is describing. Abbot mentions that Cage described a player of <em>Heavy Rain</em> who,
confronted with the decision of whether the player character should kill
another, turned the game off for two weeks. This is discovery: the player was
essaying, deciding who he wanted to be under these circumstances with these&nbsp;limitations.</p>
<p>Put in the language Moriarty borrows from Schopenhauer, the gamer was
contemplating the absence of Will&#8212;of agency. True, he was making a choice, but
I object to Moriarty&#8217;s assertion that &#8220;choice is the most fundamental expression
of Will.&#8221; If sublime art is rooted in our responses to and reflections on
experiences we can&#8217;t control, then <em>Heavy Rain</em> effects this beautifully: we can
only make the choices, perform the actions, allowed by the game (and thus by
Cage). This is what happens when the fixed narrative of a game and its
ludonarrative are intertwined&#8212;our Will is removed by that of the designer, and
we are forced to understand and accept that loss. With each interaction, agency
and intention overlap; it&#8217;s like playing a tightly braided cord. There are
certain branches, certainly, that one can take, but each of those branches leads
immediately or nearly immediately back to the same fixed&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we&#8217;re left a feeling of free will, but wondering to what extent
we&#8217;ve been controlled. Could I have saved Jason? Could it have been someone
else? Could I have stopped him from killing? But you don&#8217;t know. Without
repeated playthroughs,<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<p>In fantastic writer<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" rel="footnote">6</a></sup> <a href="http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp">Patrick Rothfuss&#8217;s</a> utterly
engrossing<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" rel="footnote">7</a></sup> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wise-Mans-Fear-Kingkiller-Chronicles/dp/0756404738/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1299955820&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Wise Man&#8217;s Fear</em></a>, Rothfuss describes
Tak,<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> a game of strategy wherein the goal of a skilled player
is not to win, but to play a beautiful game. Victory can be achieved with brutal
quickness,<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" rel="footnote">10</a></sup> but this misses the purpose of the game. What seems
to matter in Tak is the relationship between the players, the art of the game,
the way in which two sides that seem opposed make a beautiful thing&nbsp;together.</p>
<p>This seems a valuable way to think about narrativity in videogames, too. Instead of seeing the ludonarrative and the fixed narrative as oppositional, <em>Heavy Rain</em> allows the two to work together, one shaping the other, toward the goal of a well-crafted&nbsp;thing.</p>
