        <p>I have been playing Fable <span class="caps">III</span>, lately, and I really can&#8217;t get over how
extremely short the game seems to fall of its goals, at least as expressed by
<a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/xbox-360/2010/03/23/peter-molyneux-fable-3-and-emotional-games/3">this interview with Bit-Tech</a> (discovered, and post in part prompted, via
<a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2010/11/fable-iii.html">The Brainy Gamer</a>).  Abbot of the Brainy Gamer says it this way: &#8220;In
<em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em>, Peter Molyneux wants us to feel loved.&#8221;  The game is supposed to
be about connection, about relationships, about choices that affect our
ability to live in the world of Albion, and most of all about people.  But
whether ﻿because of technical floppery or design misunderstanding, the very
attempts the game makes to be personable for me make it&nbsp;emotionless.</p>
<p>So far in the game, I&#8217;ve married at least one person&#8212;whom, quite frankly, I
have more or less forgotten about&#8212;as well as my actual wife, whose hero has
visited my world once or twice.  ﻿I&#8217;ve made dozens of people love me, both
before and after I completed the game&#8217;s main storyline and in the process
became love-at-first-sight fodder for every straight woman or gay man in
Albion.  The best way to express my experience of in-game love is through my
experience ﻿with my preferred sword, <a href="http://fable.wikia.com/wiki/Avo%27s_Lamentation">Avo&#8217;s Lamentation</a>.  The sword has
the &#8220;Blessed&#8221; augmentation, which allows you to earn guild seals (read:
experience points) faster if you make 5 villagers fall in love ﻿with&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>This should be a problem in and of itself&#8212;how can a game be about love if
love is a quantifiable resource?&#8212;but the procedure for fulfilling the
requirement was both dreadfully uninteresting and, perhaps counterintuitively,
impersonal.  It went like this: I would walk up to a person, ascertain whether
they were interested in people of my sex (in my experience, incidences of
homosexuality in Albion are very low), and if so, I would interact ﻿with them
by pressing&nbsp;A.</p>
<p>At this point, the screen would fade, and recenter on myself and my partner.
My partner would have two bubbles floating over her head.  One of them was the
A button, which was labeled something like &#8220;Hug&#8221; or &#8220;Dance&#8221; or &#8220;Whistle&#8221; or
&#8220;Hero Pose&#8221; or &#8220;Tickle&#8221; or &#8220;Pat-A-Cake&#8221; (seriously).  The other was for the X
button, and was labeled something like &#8220;Chicken&#8221; or &#8220;Burp&#8221; or similar&#8212;I don&#8217;t
really know, because I never pressed X.  Pressing A allowed me to dance with
the person, or hug them, or whistle at them, or play pat-a-cake, as
appropriate.  This made them like me more.  Holding A allowed me to extend the
interaction, making them like me even more.  Holding A to the interaction&#8217;s
completion 4 times would take someone from neutral to&nbsp;friendly.</p>
<p>They would then send me to dig up something in another place, almost always at
the exact same spot in the Mistpeak mountains.  I would do so, and then we
would be friends.  Repeating the procedure with the interactions another four
times would make them want to go on a date with me.  I would drag them to a
location&#8212;most commonly the lakeside in Millfields&#8212;and they would then
announce, matter of factly, &#8220;That&#8217;s it.  I&#8217;m in love with you.&#8221;  And they
would be in love with&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>This is love in Albion: Press A.&nbsp;Repeat.</p>
<p>In fact, this is more or less everything in Albion, for a player interested in
being a &#8220;Good&#8221; character.  Pressing A is always the &#8220;good&#8221; moral choice, and
pressing &#8220;X&#8221; is always the bad one.  In fact, most of the time I was presented
﻿with a moral decision, I found myself pushing A before I even heard what the
choice <em>was</em>&#8212;I even found myself thinking about that skipped dialog as
&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavor_text">flavor text</a>.&#8221;  All of <em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em>&#8216;s lofty aspirations for love and moral
complexity in effect boil down to &#8220;Press A to be a good&nbsp;person.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it was meant to be this way.  Peter Molyneux, Fable <span class="caps">III</span>&#8217;s
creator and engine, says what makes <em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em> distinct is the ability to
<em>touch.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>﻿You can see, as soon as you give the power [to the in game character] to
﻿reach out, touch and embrace, it makes a really big difference. It’s so
﻿much more intimate than just pressing X – because you physically have to
﻿drag him there, it’s so much more involving. There are so many times when
﻿entertainment, a film or something, hits us like a tidal wave and then it
﻿just goes. If you own your own touches, if you’re making them, then you’re
﻿so much more likely to remember&nbsp;them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bit-tech inserted the phrase &#8220;to the in-game character,&#8221; but I&#8217;m not so sure
that was the original intention.  <a href="http://savetherobot.wordpress.com/">Chris</a> <a href="http://www.killscreenmagazine.com">Dahlen</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/savetherobot/status/1326993614311424">wondered aloud on
Twitter</a> recently whether some of the problems ﻿with <em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em> might be
﻿because Lionhead was originally considering Kinect (nee Natal) integration.
The interview&nbsp;confirms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We’ve been working on Natal for some time – we created Milo for the first
demo – and we’d be crazy not to integrate the two&#8230; . We were getting
lazy, tweaking people’s thumbs for 20 years. A button does this, it’s all so
standard. We, as an industry, we have failed, to some extent, to create a
unique form of entertainment and Natal makes you [as a games designer] think&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>You still need a controller to play <em>Fable 3</em> but there are places in the
world where you can use Natal, where it’s cute, funny, engaging. You don’t
need it but it does enable an enhanced <em>Fable 3</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So: some aspects of <em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em> were meant to be Kinect enabled, and those
aspects are &#8220;cute, funny, engaging&#8221;&#8212;just like in-game interactions are meant
to be.  It casts a different light on the previous quotation&#8212;the ability to
&#8220;reach out, touch, and embrace&#8221; was supposed to be <em>ours</em>, not the characters
&#8212;unless you want us to believe that what&#8217;s &#8220;so much more intimate than just
pressing X&#8221; is just pressing <em>A.</em></p>
<p>I think we were meant to hug these characters with our bodies, that in
Molyneux&#8217;s dream, we all stood in front of our <span class="caps">TV</span>&#8217;s playing pat-a-cake in
first person, staring at our partners and imagining the touch of their hands
on ours.  I think Molyneux wanted us to be our characters, and to feel&#8212;as
much as we could&#8212;like we were holding these people in our arms, dancing the
tango, hearing them laugh at our tickles, and maybe even kissing the air and
thinking of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I can see how it might have worked.  I have a Kinect, now, and it really is
amazing how different the gaming experience is when your body is the
controller.  I can only imagine how different it might have been if each time
I took one of these digital women on a date, I had to physically take their
hand, physically embrace the air I imagined was them, physically respond to
their kisses.  It would have been a much different&nbsp;game.</p>
<p>As it is, though, <em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em> fails for me precisely because it is not what it wishes to be: a game about real&nbsp;emotion.</p>
<p><em>Nota bene:</em> Wordpress informs me that at least one reader found this post as the result of the following search, which I choose to repunctuate and interpret as a&nbsp;poem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>avo&#8217;s lamentation:<br />
making 5 villagers love me<br />
