    <section class='content'>
        <p>Back when I played WoW, I used to ease my commute by listening to <a href="http://www.wcradio.com/">WoW Radio</a> (which seems to have imploded since then), and in particular <a href="http://www.vtwproductions.com/octale-hordak/">Octale and Hordak Versus the World</a>.  I don&#8217;t really know why, as in large part my response was screaming wildly at my steering wheel in violent dissent.  (Passersby, I assume, thought I was singing in my car and heavy into death metal.)  When I was a regular listener, the show seemed to be a paean to difficulty for the sake of difficulty, and Octale exploded more or less every week about the idea that games might be &#8220;fun.&#8221;  I&#8217;m no stranger to the idea that <a href="http://www.killscreenmagazine.com/?p=286">games can be no fun</a>, but it always seemed to me like Octale and Hordak&#8217;s purpose was a sort of social stratification.  There is a formula for establishing a person&#8217;s value, and its scale is&nbsp;<span class="caps">DPS</span>.</p>
<p>Usually, I love difficulty&#8212;I love being furious at a game, being frustrated, challenged, taunted by a tough game.  But not the difficulties that are meant to please &#8220;hardcore&#8221; gamers.  There&#8217;s no thrill in memorizing encounters, optimizing macros, rehearsing the <a href="http://www.wowwiki.com/Heigan">Heigan Dance</a>.  I am not a fan of bullet hell shooters (or anything else that uses hellishness as an identifying characteristic).  I was never meaningfully good at Pac Man or King Kong, as success in both of those games is a function of memorizing and executing patterns.  Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I acknowledge that a huge amount of skill is involved in doing so, and success at those games (as with high-end raiding in WoW) is an impressive achievement.  But that kind of difficulty makes games <em>less</em> meaningful for me, not <em>more.</em></p>
<p>Last month I suffered the indignity of playing <em>Demons&#8217; Souls,</em> about which <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/2009/9/14/">wiser</a> <a href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/zero-punctuation/1321-Demons-Souls">men</a> have said <a href="http://crispygamer.com/features/2010-01-04/demonic-difficulty-are-most-games-today-too-easy-or-is-demons-souls-too-hard.asp">enough</a>.  The game is brutally unforgiving, especially for a perfectionist, and playing it made me want to peel off my own toenails.  Probably the best praise I can offer is that it helped me realize my <span class="caps">TV</span> is shot.  It&#8217;s a celebration of memory, which as an essayist I suppose I should value.  With each death, you must remember how you survived before, and try to add to and extend that already inadequate survivability.  I played through the first several encounters a number of time&#8212;my perfectionism requiring me to start a completely new game every time an <span class="caps">NPC</span> got himself killed&#8212;and I gained nothing from it but fury.  What the game eschews is the difficulty I value&#8212;the kind that rewards engagement, thinking, reflection,&nbsp;self-examination.</p>
<p>I have been ensconced at my mother-in-law&#8217;s house for the last week or so, and so have been away from any console more serious than the Wii.  (I worry about Tali&#8217;Zorah vas Neema, stranded there on Haestrom with nobody but Adam Baldwin to keep her company.)  I have my iPhone, though, and have been considerably relieved by <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/doodle-god/id376374689?mt=8"><em>Doodle God</em></a>, a silly little iPhone game meant for &#8220;casuals,&#8221; the sort of game Octale and Hordak wouldn&#8217;t bother to sneer at.  I&#8217;m grinding through <em>Mass Effect 2</em> on Insanity this time around, and have already pushed past many of the harder encounters in the game.  <em><span class="caps">ME2</span></em> on Insanity definitely requires more skill than <em>Doodle God</em>, but in smaller, subtler ways, the latter is ferociously&nbsp;difficult.</p>
<p><em>Doodle God</em> has one possible interaction: you can combine elements to make new ones. A game of inimitable simplicity.  But it is, I think, more intellectually demanding than <em>Mass Effect</em> <em>2</em>, or <em>Demons&#8217; Souls</em>, or listening to Octale and Hordak grouse about casuals.  A simple system to act within, where clever, complex thinking yields unexpected results&#8212;and thought is&nbsp;rewarded.</p>
<p>In <em>Doodle God</em>, it&#8217;s little things.  I made humans.  Hoping (as always) to find myself God of the Man-Raptors, I combined human and dinosaur.  Result: Dinosaur and blood.  Ha.  Hmm: Blood + Human?  Vampire.  Ha again.  Hmm again: Vampire + Human: Vampire + Vampire.  The game rewards intuition and exploration, often hilariously.  Its hint function, too, invites you to intuit.  (&#8220;What if I create Mushroom?&#8221; the game is asking me, at present.)  I know what the action will be: I will combine two elements.  But I&#8217;m challenged to figure out&nbsp;which.</p>
<p>The games I learned on were simple.  <em>Tetris</em>.  <em>Mario</em>.  <em>Arkanoid</em>.  Games in which reflexes certainly played a role, but games in which the trick was to operate a simple system to complex results.  <em>Demons&#8217; Souls</em> didn&#8217;t provide that intellectual challenge.  Thinking wasn&#8217;t much of a part of things.  Ditto with <em>WoW</em>, at the end of things&#8212;it was more about knowing, remembering, and doing.  There was no figuring things out&#8212;there was just&nbsp;execution.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know.  Maybe I just like&nbsp;thinking.</p>    </section>
