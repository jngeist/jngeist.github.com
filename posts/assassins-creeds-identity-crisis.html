    <h1>Spoiler&nbsp;Alert</h1>
    <p>The following contains plot spoilers for <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Revelations.</em> But inasmuch as the revealed details are pretty much ridiculous, I wouldn&#8217;t worry&nbsp;too&nbsp;much.</p>
</section>

<p>Iteration is important. One of the most elegant things about the difference between, say, <em>Mass Effect</em> and <em>Mass Effect 2</em> is the way in which the combat system builds on what has come before. On the one hand, <em><span class="caps">ME2</span></em> feels like <em><span class="caps">ME</span>.</em> On the other, it&#8217;s streamlined. Simpler. More elegant. And what speaks most highly for it, I think, is that I feel like playing <em><span class="caps">ME2</span></em> made me better understand what combat in <em><span class="caps">ME</span></em> was <em>supposed</em> to&nbsp;be.</p>
<p>So I recognize that games that come in series are <em>supposed</em> to iterate. But having just finished <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed: Revelations,</em> I&#8217;m starting to remember the <em>dangers</em> of iteration.
One of my greater frustrations is the fact that <em><span class="caps">AC</span>:R</em> seems pretty severely unaware of what it actually <em>is.</em> I remember, when I first started playing the original <em><span class="caps">AC</span>,</em> being somewhat flummoxed by the appearance of Desmond, a distinctly modern and eminently clueless apparent post-skater hobo trapped in some sort of oddjob research facility. This was, I had been assured, a game about assassins, and particularly Crusades-era assassins wandering about the Holy Land. Not a game about hominid lab-rats whose greatest in-game accomplishment was going to&nbsp;bed.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve bought into it, and happily: the <em><span class="caps">AC</span></em> series is <em>about</em> Desmond, not about Altaïr or Ezio. And, to my mind, from the moment that Desmond <em>et. al.</em> bust out of the Templaricorps Ltd<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> research facility, the entire series begins building toward a very specific moment: the moment when Desmond must take the (perpetually hazy) mission of the Assassin Order into his own unemployed and mostly unskilled hands. This is really the promise of the whole series:<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that someday, all this time playing video games will pay off for Desmond, and he will suddenly <em>actually be an assassin.</em> Desmond, paying homage to the garb of his ancestors with his dirty Wal-Mart hoodie, will take the fight which I can&#8217;t remember what we&#8217;re fighting about to the Templars, because at least I remember that they&#8217;re the bad&nbsp;guys.</p>
<p>And so these are the things I have been waiting for, since that moment at the tail of game&nbsp;1:</p>
<ol>
<li>That Desmond will display genuine assassin-fu in the real&nbsp;world.</li>
<li>That he will use this ability to kick some Templar&nbsp;ass.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is not too much to&nbsp;ask.</p>
<p>But instead, I feel like the <em><span class="caps">AC</span></em> games are working through a very different&nbsp;progression: </p>
<ol>
<li>Desmond&#8217;s ancestors use increasingly anachronistic tools to play increasingly absurd&nbsp;minigames.</li>
<li>Desmond is driven around unconscious in a series of&nbsp;trucks.</li>
</ol>
<p>It&#8217;s like Desmond, shiftless roustabout that he is, can&#8217;t even be bothered to stay awake through his whirlwind tour of Europe and the Holy Land. His only achievement to speak of, in one of those exceedingly rare bouts of wakefulness, is accidentally murdering his closest ally.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the increasingly implausible landscape of his genetic memory,&nbsp;Ezio: </p>
<ul>
<li>goes on a scavenger hunt for&nbsp;books.</li>
<li>masquerades as a punk-rock&nbsp;lutist.</li>
<li>is dragged behind a speeding wagon, Indiana Jones&nbsp;style.</li>
<li>completes innumerable tasks centered around improvised (and completely impractical) explosives, such as a bomb you can stick to someone&#8217;s face such that their head explodes in a shower of fake gold coins, and to which they respond not by being concerned about the bomb but by being excited about the&nbsp;coins.</li>
<li>wanders haphazardly through the memories of Altaïr, including conducting a couple of escort missions despite the fact that he is <span class="caps">NINETY</span> <span class="caps">YEARS</span> <span class="caps">OLD</span>.</li>
<li>coordinates a series of tower-defense style excursions where we learn that the Templars have cannons, ballistae, and machine guns which they will <em>only use in this context</em> for reasons completely&nbsp;unclear.</li>
<li>defeats the heir to the Sultanate of the Ottoman Empire <strong>by accidentally inventing parasailing.</strong><sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to <em><span class="caps">AC3</span>,</em> somewhat in spite of myself. But at this point, while what I should be expecting is a conclusion, I feel like I have <em>no idea</em> what the next set of wild-eyed iterations will bring. Given the weird, persistent appearance of Greek deities and the increasingly elaborate killing methods, I&#8217;m starting to suspect that we&#8217;ll find out soon that the whole <em>Assassin&#8217;s Creed</em> series is actually an extremely elaborate prequel to <em>God of War.</em><sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote">

<p>Okay so that&#8217;s not the real name of the company, but it may as well have been.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>This is a thing that happens: while you are parasailing on the road from Constantinople to Masyaf, in order to protect your unconscionably forgiving girlfriend from an unlimited stream of Templar guards, you dip magnificently out of the sky to grab a guard off his moving horse, whereupon you hurl said guard forward&#8212;accelerating him, to my estimation, about another 15-20 mph&#8212;such that he knocks <em>another</em> guard off <em>another</em> moving horse. (Your girlfriend, despite not knowing that you are an assassin, is <em>totally fine with this.</em>)&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
