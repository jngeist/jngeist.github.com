        <p>Anhedonia is one of my favorite words.  It&#8217;s a symptom of depression,
generally speaking, but it&#8217;s such an elegant word for such a specific concept
that I can&#8217;t help but love it.  Anhedonia: the death of pleasure.  It
describes the feeling of no longer enjoying something you once enjoyed.  This
is how I feel about <em>Crackdown&nbsp;2.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing <em>Crackdown 2</em> for the last week or so, and I guess I&#8217;ve
accomplished something. It&#8217;s hard to say, really. I have killed some things, I
have jumped around a lot, I have collected random, arbitrary objects, and I have
not particularly enjoyed it. I can&#8217;t really understand this about&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>The promise of a game like <em>Crackdown 2</em> is that we can explore and develop in
the space of a world that is, more or less, indifferent to us. It reminds me of
my experience with the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> series, clearly the pioneer of the
running-around-and-killing genre. I don&#8217;t remember ever completing more than one
or two story missions in any of the games I played. Almost immediately, my
involvement with the games converted into stealing a motorcycle and running it
into everything I could find. (I was not a very good driver.) The game didn&#8217;t
care about these excursions; the little circled letters representing my missions
stayed there waiting for me, no matter how many cars I crashed, civilians I
killed, cops I was shot by, or cheat-generated tanks I flew across the sky. The
beauty of these worlds is that they offer free exploration without&nbsp;consequences.</p>
<p>The original <em>Crackdown</em> expanded on this by offering characters that developed
as you played. You developed your abilities by using them, becoming a better
shot by shooting, a better driver by driving, and more athletic by jumping
around like an idiot. So you were rewarded for this exploration with the ability
to better&nbsp;explore.</p>
<p>At the same time, though, you didn&#8217;t have a character. You played as a cloned
agent&#8212;so that each time you enter the world, you choose a new character with
the same skills and abilities as your last one. The act of choosing a new face
for every session just reinforced the world&#8217;s apathy toward you&#8212;you didn&#8217;t even
have an identity, you didn&#8217;t have your own face, you just were dipping into this
world for a&nbsp;while.</p>
<p>What I liked, maybe counterintuitively, was the sense of not making a
difference. If you ignored the story missions, the world did not care about you.
You explored the world freely, and the world moved on around you. If you did the
story missions, of course, things changed&#8212;although in <em>Crackdown</em>, you could
resurrect the bosses after you killed them, and in that way force the world to
forget you were ever there. I loved the freedom of this, the lack of obligation,
the lack of&nbsp;consequence.</p>
<p>This time around, though, I find myself enjoying less and less the things that
used to keep me engaged (in the same way that I am enjoying writing this
paragraph less and less with each subsequent attempt; boo to Blogpress and
Wordpress for iPad for continually crashing while saving). I don&#8217;t know whether
it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m less invested in the story (I am), because the game is too easy
(it is), or because the game asks me to work harder for less reward (it does),
but somehow, <em>Crackdown 2</em> is just not as compelling as <em>Crackdown</em>&nbsp;was.</p>
<p>The story for <em>Crackdown</em> (warning: spoilers ahead) was barebones, at best. It
mostly emerged from the snarky comments made by the game&#8217;s irritating announcer,
and from the game&#8217;s opening and closing sequences. But it was enough: I was
fighting gangs, and the gangs were making life difficult for residents of
Pacific City. Awesome. I&#8217;m in. Let&#8217;s bust heads. The most interesting part of
the story was the ending, which revealed that in fact all of these gangs had
been planted to make the Agency look better. Not a particularly complicated
turn, but hey, it was&nbsp;something. </p>
<p>In <em>Crackdown 2</em>, though, I am fighting two groups: mindless, light-sensitive
zombies called Freaks and an ostensible terrorist organization called the Cell,
who contend that the Agency started the zombie plague to begin with. Well, <em>of
course we did.</em> Given what I know about the Agency, how can I doubt it? And
given that, how can I derive any sense of satisfaction about fighting either
group of enemies? It&#8217;s like playing 52-Card Pickup by&nbsp;yourself.</p>
<p>On top of that, the game feels easier this time around. Before, Agility orbs
were uncommon, and perched atop the highest buildings. I remember seeing Agility
orbs atop skyscrapers, and trying for hours to figure out how to get up to the
top of the building, what was climbable nearby and what wasn&#8217;t, where there were
places I could duck inside to gain a few floors. In <em>Crackdown 2</em>, they&#8217;re on
top of shipping containers. You start out in an area where there are something
like fifty orbs scattered around, each at the end of an easy jump or climb. The
game seems saturated with the things, to the degree that I don&#8217;t really feel
accomplished when I obtain them. It feels like&nbsp;grinding.</p>
<p>As a result of this, and making things worse, is the feeling that you have to
find umpteen craptillion of these things to actually get a skill bonus. I am
constantly chasing orbs, including the new fancypants &#8220;renegade orbs&#8221; that run
around idiotically such that you have to chase them around the rooftops like a
buffoon. But because these orbs are now so abundant, each one makes up a smaller
percentage of a skill boost, and so each is less rewarding&#8212;both emotionally and
in terms of game benefit. I am working harder to get&nbsp;nowhere.</p>
<p>All in all, what I feel most during <em>Crackdown 2</em> is the sense that I should be
enjoying this more than I am, that I used to enjoy this more than I do, but that
somehow, the things that made the game worth playing have somehow turned up
missing. That the pleasure of the game has died. I wish there were some more
compelling conclusion to this experience, some forceful, insightful thing I
could say, but the fact that I can&#8217;t mirrors the path of the game&#8212;the quick,
irretrievable descent into apathy. There&#8217;s nothing more to the game that I can&nbsp;find.</p>    </section>
