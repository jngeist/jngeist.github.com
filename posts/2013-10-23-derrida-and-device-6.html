    <section class='content'>
        <p>Recently, I <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/device-6/">reviewed <em><span class="caps">DEVICE</span> 6</em></a> for <em>Kill Screen,</em> and it was all I could do to limit myself to a barely-noticed link to a Derrida quotation. The experience of the game as a game was great, and for the most part, I don&#8217;t think one needs a background in critical theory to play it. But for me, I think it&#8217;s much more interesting as a text&#8212;which, I guess, is the whole&nbsp;point.</p>
<h2>Sequined Parachute&nbsp;Pants</h2>
<p>One of my favorite screwers-around-with-form, <a href="!g">John D&#8217;Agata</a>, gave a reading at <span class="caps">CSUF</span> while I was in grad school, and at the Q&amp;A beforehand he talked about the problems with experimental form. Most of the submissions he got at <a href="!
g" title="Seneca Review">Seneca</a> were experimental for no particular reason&#8212;or rather, were experimental for the sake of being experimental. If the form isn&#8217;t integral to the mechanism of the piece&#8212;if it could be accomplished with a traditional form, if the piece didn&#8217;t <em>need</em> the formal manipulations&#8212;it generally reads like a ridiculous-looking bid for attention. Like, he suggested, a man wearing sequined parachute&nbsp;pants.</p>
<p>I think of that a lot when I&#8217;m trying weird stuff, which is usually. In fact, with the <em>D6</em> review, I was originally planning on having the Rereading section end with a link back to the top of the article, after which more detail would reveal itself, changing the focus of the text. But ultimately I felt like that would be good, useful, interesting, and supportive of the text&#8212;but not <em>necessary.</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve continued to think about the formal experiments in <em>D6,</em> I&#8217;ve become increasingly convinced that there are really two different manipulations at work. One of them, I think, is necessary. The other is &#8230;&nbsp;complicated.</p>
<h2>Interstices</h2>
<p>The first major manipulation of form in <em>D6</em> is the one my review focused on: the interstitial interactions between the player and <span class="caps">HAT</span>. To sum up the review, at first, those interactions feel extraneous, and in particular it&#8217;s hard to tell what matters. After the first chapter, you&#8217;re asked some questions about obscure details from the chapter, and you wonder what happens if you get those questions right or wrong. At the conclusion of the questions, you receive a score&#8212;100 points, in my case&#8212;and it is not clear what, if anything, that score means. As the game approaches its conclusion, it becomes obvious that it is not Simogo asking those questions, but <span class="caps">HAT</span>, and that these lags in the game are integral to its&nbsp;story.</p>
<p>The questions and tasks that those interstitial surveys present you with are great in and of themselves, and are full of subtle, smirk-inspiring jabs at the corporate culture whose voice they co-opt. (In one section, you respond by answering questions on a scale of 1-5 hearts; the final question in the section is, &#8220;For administrative purposes, please mark five hearts.&#8221;) It&#8217;s those moments that make the game play like a focus group for a game, rather than a game itself, and those interactions remove you from the reality of the story&#8212;but the reality they remove you <em>into</em> isn&#8217;t exactly your&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>This is the mechanism that is, I think, essential for the game to work. It does a lot of work in setting the tone of the game, in keeping the player unsettled, and especially in reframing the player&#8217;s role and identity as the story&nbsp;progresses. </p>
<h2>Dynamic&nbsp;Text</h2>
<p>This is the part I&#8217;m less sure about. On the one hand, without <em>D6</em>&#8216;s excursions into nonlinear text, there really wouldn&#8217;t be much <em>game</em> there. I think iOS is a perfect place to do this kind of thing, and I think <em>D6</em> does it beautifully. And I haven&#8217;t seen anything quite like it, either. It&#8217;s the interplay of image, sound, text, and movement that makes the game what it is&#8212;at least in terms of gameplay&#8212;and I&#8217;m glad that Simogo is willing to take this kind of leap. It&#8217;s excellently done and welcome in the market&#8212;but Iâ€™m not sure whether it&#8217;s <em>necessary.</em></p>
<p>The notion of nonlinear text is not a new one by any means, and in fact, it&#8217;s <a href="!wiki" title="hypertext">more or less the concept the web is built on.</a> And in fact&#8212;as anyone who&#8217;s searched Wikipedia for the French Foreign Legion and come up for air seven hours later at the <a href="!wiki">list of serial killers by number of victims</a> can tell you&#8212;the divergent, fractal nature of hypertext is a much more powerful deviation from the traditional linear format than <em>D6,</em> by a long shot. The web is like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure where any given page can be both an entry point or an ending, as well as just another fork on a road. Forgive me for this, but it allows <a href="!w%20idic">infinite diversity in infinite combination</a>. </p>
