        <p>After I watched <em>Joker,</em> I turned (as I so often do, sometimes against my better judgment) to Reddit for discussion. The first comment I saw got caught in my head, and it&#8217;s been rattling around in there since then, as it feels like it purely captures the essential wrongness undergirding the vast majority of thinkpieces and hot takes that I&#8217;ve encountered. I don&#8217;t mean to invalidate this person&#8217;s response at all, and I completely get where it&#8217;s coming from. But what the commenter leaves out represents exactly what it feels like the whole media conversation about this film leaves out. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/dd0ynj/official_discussion_joker_spoilers/f3zsy4z/">Here&#8217;s the comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I loved the movie, dont get me wrong. It&#8217;s a fresh, hard hitting look at a complex character and I am astounded at the work and quality that went into this, the gritty no holds barred realism they went for. However, their focus on his mental illness and the line &#8220;what do you get when you cross a mentally I&#8217;ll loner with..&#8221; made me scrounge down in my seat. [&#8230;] I feel an approach more focused on societal pressure and politics would have balanced this&nbsp;message.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this comment&#8212;and, to my mind, the majority of the thinkpieces I&#8217;ve come across&#8212;leaves out is, in essence, the core message of the film. The full quote is this: &#8220;What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with <em>a society who abandons him and treats him like crap?</em> You get what you deserve.&#8221;
Most of the <em>Joker</em> hot takes I&#8217;ve seen seem to latch on to the violence, the film&#8217;s framing of Arthur Fleck as an empathetic character, and what is consistently presented as a glorification of alt-right incel indignation. And to me, this seems almost patently absurd. I&#8217;ve heard Joker&#8217;s monologue on the <em>Murray Franklin</em> show cited as evidence that the film is unsubtle, and I&#8217;ve heard other commenters on Reddit suggest that the film doesn&#8217;t even have a message, that it&#8217;s all just violence for the sake of violence. But that commentary overlooks the subtleties that form the core of the film, and which are rendered explicit in the second half of the Joker&#8217;s last onscreen &#8220;joke.&#8221; <em>Joker</em> isn&#8217;t a film about how mental illness leads to violence. It is a film about how <em>systematically ignoring the needs of individuals on a societal level</em> leads to&nbsp;violence.</p>
<p>So in this post, I want to talk about two things. First, I want to point out the life that Arthur Fleck should have had, and in fact would have had if things went slightly differently. Second, I want to look at the chain of events that leads to Fleck&#8217;s breakdown, and draw attention to what seems to me a fairly explicit condemnation of the true villain of the film: a failed social safety&nbsp;net.</p>
<h2>What Should Have&nbsp;Been</h2>
<p>Arthur Fleck, as we first encounter him at the beginning of the film, is already schizophrenic. He has a neurological condition that causes him to laugh at inappropriate times, and he is unable to control that laughter. He is a single adult who is the sole caretaker of his invalid mother. His dialog in several places suggests a sort of developmental delay. He is, to say the least, not blessed with all the preparation and skills we might hope for in a successful&nbsp;adult.</p>
<p>But: <em>he is a damn good clown.</em> He truly enjoys, and truly excels at, entertaining children. His physical comedy is its own kind of art, and he is truly skilled at it. We see this a bunch of times. The first is the case of the child on the bus. Before the kid&#8217;s mom yells at Fleck, they&#8217;re both clearly having a great time. We see it also in the children&#8217;s hospital, where right up to the point where he drops the gun (which I admit is probably not the best we&#8217;d hope for in a clown), everybody is laughing and having a good time. Fleck is excellent at entertaining&nbsp;children.</p>
<p>So: at the beginning of the film, Fleck is gainfully employed in a career to which he is very well suited, despite any limitations that might affect his capacities. He and his mother don&#8217;t seem to be well off, but we don&#8217;t see any of the traditional signals of financial collapse&#8212;bill collectors, eviction notices, calls from creditors. The mailbox is perpetually empty. This is definitely not the best life, but at the start of the film, <em>Fleck is&nbsp;self-sufficient.</em> </p>
<p>And&#8212;although I would argue that this is a result of abusive parenting&#8212;Fleck sees his goal in life as to spread joy and happiness in the world. So not only is he self-sufficient, he is also performing what he believes to be his purpose in&nbsp;life.</p>
<p>There is no reason that this could not have continued indefinitely. Despite his mental illness and disabilities, Fleck could have lived a long, satisfied life as a clown. Penny is clearly horrified by their circumstances, but Arthur did not seem to&nbsp;be. </p>
<p>So what&nbsp;happened?</p>
