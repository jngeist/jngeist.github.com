        <p>There&#8217;s a scene in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magicians-Novel-Lev-Grossman/dp/0452296293/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278622307&amp;sr=8-1">The Magicians</a> where one character pounds the hell
out of another, seemingly unprovoked.  A friend says of the fight that the
pummeler&#8217;s agression had been building for a while.  &#8221;He was either going to
hit you or start a blog,&#8221; the friend says.  &#8221;Honestly, I&#8217;m kind of glad he hit
you.&#8221;  Starting a blog feels a little like farting in an elevator.  I&#8217;m doing
something most people do at some point, intentionally or otherwise, but
something that is nevertheless slightly embarrassing and very public.  But as
you&#8217;ll see, I&#8217;ve had a growing discomfort with how people are talking and
writing about video games, which is what I spend a lot of my time doing,
mostly while my wife puts her fingers in her ears and goes &#8220;<span class="caps">LA</span> <span class="caps">LA</span> <span class="caps">LA</span>.&#8221;  Two of
the things at the core of my identity are gaming and essay writing, so this
blog will in part be a space for me to rub those two things together in a way
that is hopefully fruitful, and hopefully not too&nbsp;lascivious.</p>
<p>You probably already know about <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">this</a>, Roger Ebert&#8217;s recent rearticulation
of his established claim that &#8220;video games can never be art.&#8221;  Ebert&#8217;s full
post is to my mind somewhat misdirected&#8212;it might better be titled &#8220;I am not
persuaded by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9y6MYDSAww">Kellee Santiago&#8217;s <span class="caps">TED</span> talk</a>&#8220;&#8212;but he better articulates his
own view in his <a href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html">retraction</a>, posted earlier this month.  His core
contention seems to be that games cannot be art&#8212;or, at least, are not art&#8212;
because they are not constrained enough by authorial oversight.  &#8220;Art seeks to
lead you to an inevitable conclusion,&#8221; he writes, &#8220;not a smorgasbord of
choices.&#8221;  For Ebert, the defining problem of videogames is that there is too
much&nbsp;freedom.</p>
<p>You may not have seen <a href="http://brevity.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/extra-lives-are-games-the-new-novels/">this</a>, <a href="http://myatomicangst.blogspot.com/">Steven Church</a>&#8216;s recent post about Tom
Bissell&#8217;s recent book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Extra-Lives-Video-Games-Matter/dp/0307378705/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1278606192&amp;sr=8-1">Extra Lives</a></em><em> </em>on <a href="http://brevitymag.com/">Brevity&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://brevity.wordpress.com/">blog</a>.  &#8220;My
basic problem with video games,&#8221; Church&nbsp;writes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is in many ways my problem with most contemporary plot-driven fiction and
film. I get bored with the plot-fueled narrative&#8230; . Games are not (like
Tom’s book) digressive, fragmented and irrational or lyrical. They are, by
design, the product of authorial purpose, and mostly linear progression—all
of which are things I can appreciate but which I don’t necessarily seek out
as an artistic (or entertainment)&nbsp;experience.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course I&#8217;ve played games that are digressive (<em>Elder Scrolls <span class="caps">IV</span>:
Oblivion</em>), fragmented (<em>Heavy Rain</em>), irrational (<em>Day of the Tentacle</em>) and
lyrical (is <em>Braid</em> too easy?).  What rankles, though, is Church&#8217;s insistence
that games &#8220;just aren’t essayistic.&#8221;  For Church, the defining problem of
videogames is that there is not enough&nbsp;freedom.</p>
<p>For me, the precise reason I enjoy gaming is because it is essayistic.  To me,
each of these writers is answering the other&#8217;s objection in a meaningful,
instructive way.  The real promise of videogames as art lies in the tension
between authorial intention and player agency.  Ebert&#8217;s piece struggles
against his inability to define &#8220;art,&#8221; a term for which I have no fondness
precisely because of its airy imprecision.  But Church does define &#8220;essay,&#8221; or
at least alludes to a definition: what marks an essay, he suggests, is
&#8220;digressive, consciousness-driven explorations.&#8221;  Essay titan Philip Lopate
<a href="http://www.pw.org/content/interview_creative_nonfiction_writer_phillip_lopate">clarifies</a>: &#8220;I am more interested in the display of consciousness on the
page [than in plot-driven narrative]. The reason I read nonfiction is to
follow an interesting mind.&#8221;  Essaying is a process of thinking through,
figuring out, and above all <em>attempting</em>&#8212;which process rests at the core of
good&nbsp;gaming.</p>
<p>In <em>Extra Lives, </em>Bissell tells a story about <em>Mass Effect</em>, and an encounter
the main character, Shepard, has with a Hanar evangelist in the Citadel.  In
short, Shepard has to decide whether to help an alien proselytizer convince a
security policeman to allow the Hanar to speak, or whether to helpt he
policeman run the Hanar out of town.  Across several playthroughs, Bissell
writes, he &#8220;found it difficult to have [his] Shepherd say anything even
remotely pro-religion.&#8221;  I, too, have played through the encounter several
times, and every time, I either end up buying the Hanar the permit or talking
the guard into leaving, depending on how charming my character happens to be
at the moment.  I always avoid the religious discussion, and I&#8217;m not
particularly empathetic to his perspective (while I&#8217;m a person of faith
myself, I am categorically opposed to evangelism).  But I always find a way to
let the Hanar&nbsp;preach.</p>
<p>I think my Shepard&#8217;s actions reflect&#8212;although I am not necessarily
consciously thinking of this at the time&#8212;<em>my</em> belief that no one should have
to purchase the right to free speech.  Our differing responses, as gamers, to
the same stimulus can&#8217;t tell us anything about the game, but it can tell us a
lot about <em>us</em>&#8212;not Jane Shepard and Jane Shepard, but Josh Geist and Tom
Bissell.  The tension between a gamer&#8217;s choices and the limitations of the
system isn&#8217;t a problem, but a tool of the medium&#8212;a way of letting us examine
ourselves.  As Bissell writes, &#8220;[G]ames become uniquely compelling when they
force you to the edge of some drawn, real-life line of intellectual or moral
obligation that, to your mild astonishment, you find you cannot step across.&#8221;
Which is to say, navigating the set possibilities of an encounter in a game
forces a gamer to examine the nature of the character she&#8217;s playing, and to
interface that imagined personality with her own identity, finding the places
in her that will stretch, and those that won&#8217;t.  The best moments in gaming
are moments of self-discovery for the&nbsp;gamer.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to be said about this, and I expect I will return to these issues
again and again in this blog, but I think this will serve neatly enough as a
founding principle: whether art or not, video games are rich fields for
essaying against, in, and through.  More than any other medium (with the
possible exception of writing) offer space for self-definition, self-
discovery, self-exploration, and self-revelation.  They are places where we
work to decide who we are, and who we want to be.  Spaces for interesting
minds to&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>Well.  Excuse me.  From here on out, it&#8217;ll just be like farting in an elevator
that is already stinky&#8212;that is, the damage is done, probably nobody will
notice, and each iteration will relieve a little pressure and get us all
closer to where we&#8217;re&nbsp;going.</p>            </section>
