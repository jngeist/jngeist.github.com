    <section class='content'>
        <p>Just before the election, <a href="">Radiolab</a> ran an episode seeking out those mythical moments where one vote made a difference. They did it too early.  On March 3, something went badly wrong with <a href="http://www.marchfadness.com"><em>March Fadness</em></a>, in a way which arguably speaks to the fundamental failure of democracy in which we are all immersed. Specifically: <a href="battle1">Marc Cohn&#8217;s &#8220;Walking in Memphis&#8221; lost to <span class="caps">OMC</span>&#8217;s &#8220;How Bizarre&#8221; by one vote</a>. </p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with <em>March Fadness,</em> the tournament&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marchfadness.com/wtf/"><span class="caps">WTF</span></a> page&nbsp;explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>March Fadness</em> features one-hit wonders of the 1990s pitted against each other in ridiculous and possibly pointless games, all in search of understanding the 1990s and its culture as well as the uses and failures of&nbsp;memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is what makes <em><span class="caps">MF</span></em> particularly beautiful, I think: it suggests that the <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/01/16/article-2263127-16F73FEA000005DC-186_634x822.jpg">ridiculousness of the 1990s</a> can somehow give rise to an understanding of ourselves and our culture&#8212;that, say, asking us to choose between <a href="http://www.marchfadness.com/#/skeelovshaddaway/">&#8220;I Wish&#8221; and &#8220;What Is Love&#8221;</a> can give us a way of examining the gaps between who we are now and who we were then. The tournament assumes that the question asked in each round&#8212;&#8221;Which song is the best?&#8221;&#8212;means something bigger and deeper than its simple wording&nbsp;implies.</p>
<p>Come with me this far, at least: <em>March Fadness</em> is in truth an essay made of essays, a great metaekphrasis<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> using art and memory to heighten and sharpen one another&#8217;s mystery. <em>March Fadness</em> is rooted in a belief that art&#8212;even the one-hit wonders of the 90s&#8212;offers access to&nbsp;humanity.</p>
<p>These votes are immensely complex; if two of us vote for the same song, can we say w/ any certainty that those two votes mean the same thing? We cannot. Are people voting for the songs? For the videos? For the memories? For the essays? For the essayists? For the preservation of their own brackets? Or <em>against</em> any of those things, as I always root for whoever the Jets are playing? Or do all these strands braid around the maypole of a single radio button? Can we have a meaningful conversation about &#8220;which song is the best&#8221; if we are not in communion about what purpose art&nbsp;serves?</p>
<p>That last question is why Justin St. Germain&#8212;and, by extension, <span class="caps">OMC</span>&#8217;s &#8220;How Bizarre&#8221;&#8212;must be&nbsp;stopped. </p>
<p>St. Germain begins his essay by explicitly discarding the idea of aesthetics, observing that the alleged experts walking the halls of museums seem to have differing standards for interpreting art. His response is personal: &#8220;I mostly just like to stare at it for a while, and see if I can see the genius.&#8221; The conclusion this points toward is that exposure is &#8220;all you really need to formulate some aesthetics.&#8221; The feeling I get&#8212;which, I think, pervades his essay&#8212;is that because there are so many standards, aesthetics must be subjective, and that if aesthetics are subjective, they must therefore be personal and individual. I don&#8217;t know whether Justin St. Germain is a climate denier, but this is certainly the climate denier&#8217;s stance: <em>there are conflicting opinions; therefore, all opinions must be equally&nbsp;valid.</em> </p>
<p>Thus, his argument is rooted in the personal. &#8220;Quick: what does &#8216;How Bizarre&#8217; remind you of?&#8221; What makes art valuable&#8212;or, at least, what makes the art of 90s one-hit wonders valuable&#8212;is how powerfully it is linked to his personal memories. He attempts to colonize ours, too; despite what St. Germain seems to think, I <em>don&#8217;t</em> have any of &#8220;How Bizarre&#8221; memorized, except for the words &#8220;How Bizarre.&#8221; He glances back briefly at the question of aesthetics, but only sarcastically. He winks at some metrics of value&#8212;&#8221;How Bizarre&#8221; was popular; <span class="caps">OMC</span> has an interesting story; one specific image and line from the video resonates in a <span class="caps">PT</span> Barnum sort of way with current events&#8212;but he does not seriously engage them as ways of comparing. (&#8220;<span class="caps">OMC</span> is better because of the story&#8221; works only if it is held up against Mark Cohn&#8217;s&nbsp;story.&#8221;)</p>
<p>All of this points toward a solipsistic, cynical view of human endeavor, but what bothers me most are the constant jabs at &#8220;Walking in Memphis.&#8221; It&#8217;s not on Memphis&#8217;s wikipedia page, hurr hurr. There&#8217;s not a book about it, hurr hurr. It doesn&#8217;t belong in the National Gallery, hurr hurr. As &#8220;How Bizarre&#8221; has advanced through the tournament, these snarklets have been tweaked to address each opponent, revealing how little merit they have. These digs are superficial and even nonsensical&#8212;will &#8220;How Bizarre&#8221; end up in the National Gallery?&#8212;but they all speak to a way of thinking about art that I find deeply unsettling: <em>my thing is good because I like it, and therefore I denigrate your thing without attempting to understanding&nbsp;it.</em></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a contrast too between the stories of the songs&#8212;
<span class="caps">LO</span> says that With &#8220;Walking in Memphis,&#8221; Cohn tried to find his way into real, satisfying art by finding a way to love a place he did not know; in doing so, he found a way to make me love a place I&#8217;ve never been, at least a little. <span class="caps">JSG</span>: <span class="caps">OMC</span>&#8217;s next attempt at stardom, a cover of &#8220;I Love <span class="caps">LA</span>.&#8221; He tried to secure personal gain by <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/01/21/trump-had-a-huge-luxurious-inauguration-cake-was-it-plagiarized/?utm_term=.905e3d9d1cd4">plagiarizing Randy Newman&#8217;s feelings</a> for a city that everyone is supposed to know how to love, and failing&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>It is a bad essay that beat a good essay, a bad song that beat a good song, id that beat&nbsp;superego.</p>
<p>And the question that she doesn&#8217;t seem to speak to, which is at the root of the whole thing: &#8220;Do I really feel the way I&nbsp;feel?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I voted, &#8220;Walking&#8221; was well behind&nbsp;&#8220;Bizarre,&#8221; </p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Does &#8216;Walking in Memphis&#8217; speak to the best of humanity?&#8221; Justin St. Germain is asking, &#8220;Was &#8216;How Bizarre&#8217; playing on my stolen boombox while I felt up Shelly Wallace in the back of my Ranchero?&#8221; I don&#8217;t care so much that Mark Cohn lost to <span class="caps">OMC</span>, but I do care that people who ask the first kind of question lost to people who ask the&nbsp;second.</p>
