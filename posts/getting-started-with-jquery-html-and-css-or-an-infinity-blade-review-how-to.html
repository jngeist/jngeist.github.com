        <p>A while ago, someone asked me how to get started making something like my
<a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/infinity-blade">Infinity Blade Review</a> over at <a href="http://www.killscreendaily.com">Kill Screen</a>. I started writing her an
email, and it became huge, so I decided I’d post it here in case it might be of
use to somebody else, as well. Here it&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>The short answer to your question is that while I think the stuff I
used–<a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, mostly–will do exactly what you need it to do, it’s probably
kind of a long road from just starting out to being able to do something like
that. I’ve been programming for most of my life (wow, I just realized that’s
true. I’m old), and still, the programming part of that review took
longer–significantly longer, I think–than the writing&nbsp;part.</p>
<p>But I am absolutely no good at short answers, so here’s a much longer&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>I don’t know what your level of experience with web technologies is, or what
exactly you mean when you say “programming novice,” so forgive me if I assume
you don’t know stuff you already do. I’m going to assume that you’ve never made
a web page or written a program before. That said, here are some things you’ll
need to understand and, after that, some things to look at to help you get&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>First and most fundamental is <span class="caps">HTML</span>, the language that web pages are made of. You
don’t have to know all the fancy stuff, but in order to get what you want going,
you need to be able to use <span class="caps">HTML</span> at least on a basic level. (<span class="caps">HTML</span> is the tool
you’ll use to establish the structure of your&nbsp;document.)</p>
<p>Second, and most important, is <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is what’s called an <span class="caps">API</span>
for Javascript,<sup id="fnref:a1"><a href="#fn:a1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> and this is what’ll move stuff around, hide stuff,
show stuff, etc. In my Infinity Blade review, jQuery is what fades stuff in and
out, and basically makes the whole thing&nbsp;go.</p>
<p>Third, and probably least important (but still significant) is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a>. <span class="caps">CSS</span> is
what will allow you to decide how things look. (jQuery hides and shows things in
my review by changing the <span class="caps">CSS</span> properties, which tells your browser what things
should look&nbsp;like.)</p>
<p>And, to make things even more complicated, each of these tools requires a
completely different way of thinking. jQuery is closest to normal programming,
but <span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span> are their own&nbsp;beasts.</p>
<p>I don’t say any of this to discourage you; quite frankly, anybody who can beat
<span class="caps">SMB</span>, no warps, one life is probably capable of handling any challenge, and
should probably be an astronaut or a surgeon or president or something. I’m sure
you can handle this, and what you’re wanting is actually pretty simple–it’s just
a simple combination of what might be three unfamiliar&nbsp;technologies.</p>
<p>Here’s basically what your process will look&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lay out your document in&nbsp;<span class="caps">HTML</span>. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use jQuery to do stuff with the <span class="caps">HTML</span>, probably either moving stuff around or adding/removing <span class="caps">CSS</span> properties or&nbsp;classes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>use <span class="caps">CSS</span> to make everything look the way you&nbsp;want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a big process, I know, so here are some resources to help you get&nbsp;started:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://code.google.com/edu/submissions/html-css-javascript/">Google’s “From the Ground Up” series</a>. I haven’t watched these myself,
    but they’re supposed to be a good resource on web design for beginners, and they
    should at least help you get the basics of <span class="caps">HTML</span> and&nbsp;<span class="caps">CSS</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://htmldog.com/">HTMLDog</a> also has some good tutorials and whatnot to get you&nbsp;started.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forgive me if you are disdainful of Reddit, but <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/">Reddit’s
    /r/learnprogramming subreddit</a> is a good place to ask questions, and their
    <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all">top links of all time</a> also has some good resources in&nbsp;it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page">jQuery’s documentaton</a> and <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials">tutorials</a> are really&nbsp;good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you get your bearings, <a href="http://reference.sitepoint.com/html">Sitepoint’s Reference Section</a> has a lot of
    good information, but it’s designed as a reference, not a&nbsp;how-to.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Last thing I’ll say is this: jQuery is really powerful, and pretty simple. It
can do all kinds of things, so try to keep in mind that what you saw in my
review is really just an example of things that you can do, and there are
probably much cooler things that you can do in your&nbsp;situation.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know what this means, except to understand that jQuery
  is an extension of Javascript. For your purposes, you don’t need to worry about
  plain Javascript; jQuery will make that way easier for you.&#160;<a href="#fnref:a1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
