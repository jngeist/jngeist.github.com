    <h1>An Explanatory&nbsp;Note</h1>
    <p>There&#8217;s this scene in one of the <em>Wayne&#8217;s World</em> movies where after somehow screwing things up for Cassandra&#8217;s band, Wayne and his team of misfits hijack a satellite signal to take over the airwaves specifically to beam a Crucial Taunt performance into the limousine of a specific record exec. This is kind of that. In sum, for anybody who isn&#8217;t Mat Marquis (@wilto), for a period of several years I ran a Twitter parody account called @colin_loves_mat that riffed on @wilto&#8217;s apparent loathing of The Decemberists. He never found out who I was, and so here I am, drawing back&nbsp;the&nbsp;curtain.</p>
</section>

<p>mat.</p>
<p>hi&nbsp;mat.</p>
<p>hi.</p>
<p>have you adequately prepared yourself? because<br />
i will now remove the mask<br />
of weird hipster affectations<br />
that I donned as <a href="https://twitter.com/colin_loves_mat">@colin_loves_mat</a>, </p>
<p>and you will clearly observe from this website that I, <a href="https://twitter.com/jnicholasgeist">@jnicholasgeist</a>, have <span class="caps">ABSOLUTELY</span> <span class="caps">NO</span> weird hipster affectations at&nbsp;all.</p>
<p>So hi. I&#8217;m Josh. I&#8217;m more or less a random internet oddjob who, for a period of a few years, badgered you with maritime nonsense for my own (and hopefully your)&nbsp;amusement.</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t know me, but you might have seen some of my work.  Back in 2011-2012, I was doing a lot of <a href="/oddities/">weird web stuff for the video game magazine <em>Kill Screen</em></a>, including some stuff you may have seen. One of my favorite projects that I did for <em><span class="caps">KS</span></em>, my <a href="/oddities/infinity-blade/">review of <em>Infinity Blade</em></a>, generated <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fkillscreendaily.com%2Farticles%2Freviews%2Finfinity-blade">some buzz</a> of the &#8220;hey look at this cool javascript thingy&#8221; variety. <a href="https://twitter.com/savetherobot">Chris Dahlen</a> was Editor-in-Chief of <em><span class="caps">KS</span></em> at the time, and Chris had previously worked with Ethan Marcotte. Chris showed it to Ethan, <a href="https://twitter.com/beep/status/81543719127490560">who seems to have thought it was cool</a>. </p>
<p>Anyway, I was doing a lot more web stuff at the time than I am now (as is evidenced by the pronounced 2012iness of this website), and I followed you among other prominent web-carers-about on Twitter. I thought you were funny, and I was especially engaged by your enthusiastic disdain for the Decemberists (who, for the record, I love genuinely and unapologetically). But man, Mat, lemme tell ya the Decemberists aesthetic is an absolute delight to make fun of, so I did. For several years. Versus&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>I think early on, I did try to mimic certain elements of @beep&#8217;s tweetvoice to throw you off the trail, but looking back, I&#8217;m actually both baffled and delighted that you didn&#8217;t figure out it was me&#8212;not because you had any particular reason to know who I was, but because literally the day before I created @colin_loves_mat this conversation&nbsp;happened:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/jnicholasgeist?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jnicholasgeist</a> Drowning&nbsp;please.</p>&mdash; Mat Marquis (@wilto) <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto/status/250622971444617217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2012</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </p>
<p>But you didn&#8217;t, so I just&#8230; kept pestering you. I was aware of the parasocial nature of the interactions, but it seemed like we were both having fun, so I didn&#8217;t worry about it too much&#8212;until eventually, this&nbsp;happened:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/colin_loves_mat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@colin_loves_mat</a>&nbsp;why</p>&mdash; Mat Marquis (@wilto) <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto/status/700486669783453698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2016</a></blockquote>

<p>My inference from that&#8212;which may have been way overblown&#8212;was that you had stopped seeing this as fun, and had started seeing it as invasive, and that was never something I wanted. I just wanted to make fun of the Decemberists, Mat. That&#8217;s all I ever wanted to do. (In a way, it&#8217;s all <em>anyone</em> wants to do, isn&#8217;t it?) I figured if you weren&#8217;t having fun anymore, it was time to&nbsp;stop.</p>
<p>And so I did! And then forgot about it for four years, remembered last week, and here we are. You&#8217;re up to&nbsp;date.</p>
<p>So I hope you had some fun, and weren&#8217;t too creeped&nbsp;out. </p>
<p>because mat<br />
i only like to creep people out<br />
with haunting minor-key melodies<br />
about the ghosts of working-class Victorians.<br />
and you are not one of those,<br />
mat,<br />
are&nbsp;you?</p>            </section>
