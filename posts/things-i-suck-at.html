        <p>I <a href="/categories/geek">fiddle around with a lot of things.</a>  It&#8217;s in my nature. I began listing my recent forays into configuring email as an example, and I realized quite quickly that the odyssey ought to be its own post. The reason I do this sort of fiddling, though, almost always composed of two intertwining mental&nbsp;phenomena:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know what I need,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>I know the limitations of the thing I&#8217;m fiddling&nbsp;with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, when we&#8217;re talking about software or something similar, I know up front what the limitations are; often, though, I only find out by playing around with it. Likewise, I often know what I need up front; other times, though, I only find out what I need by finding out where my needs rub up against the limitations of whatever it is I&#8217;m trying to work&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>As I was listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/71">Back to Work 71</a>, I started thinking about the problems that exist in organizations&#8212;things like the <a href="http://passiveaggressivenotes.com/">passive aggression</a> that Merlin and Dan were discussing&#8212;as functions of that same pair of forces. More specifically, it made me think about the problems I have as a teacher with my students, the problems my students have with me as a teacher, and perhaps most importantly, the problems I have with myself as a teacher.  <span class="pull">All these problems&#8212;and perhaps all problems&#8212;come down to a conflict between one party&#8217;s expectations and another party&#8217;s&nbsp;limitations.</span></p>
<p>At that point&#8212;and at that absurdly high level of abstraction&#8212;there are two ways to go about resolving the&nbsp;problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>Revise the expectation,&nbsp;or</li>
<li>Resolve the&nbsp;limitation.</li>
</ol>
<p>What occurred to me as I was listening is that in the same way that what David Allen calls the <a href="http://www.wikisummaries.org/Getting_Things_Done:_The_Art_of_Stress-Free_Productivity#Chapter_9_--_Doing:_Making_the_Best_Action_Choices">10,000 foot perspective</a> is important to understanding the everyday projects and actions we undertake, <span class="pull">understanding my own limitations on a broad scale can, I think, help me avoid the problems I tend to face in the classroom (and, I suspect,&nbsp;beyond).</span></p>
<p>Thus: <a href="/things-i-suck-at">Things I Suck At</a>.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Remembering.</em> Really: I don&#8217;t remember <em>anything.</em> If you talked to me about it half an hour ago, there&#8217;s a decent chance I&#8217;ve already forgotten it. I don&#8217;t mean to; it&#8217;s just the truth of me. If you need me to remember something, or to do something for you, <em>email me.</em> Just talking to me will do pretty much no&nbsp;good.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Planning ahead.</em> I am writing this on July 11, 2012, and by my standards, that&#8217;s an <em>absurd</em> amount of foresight for a Fall semester. Whether with my classes or with my life, I am generally no good at planning ahead. Sometimes this is because I&#8217;ve let time get away from me (see below), but a lot of the time&#8212;at least in the context of my classes&#8212;it&#8217;s because what I&#8217;m doing on any given day is determined by what&#8217;s happened in class in the days&nbsp;before.</p>
<p>The upshot for anyone more future-oriented than myself, though, is that if you ask me a question like &#8220;What are we doing in class next Friday,&#8221; I probably can&#8217;t answer, because it likely depends rather a lot on what happens in class next&nbsp;Wednesday. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Estimating time.</em> <strong><span class="caps">OH</span> <span class="caps">MAN</span></strong> do I suck at this. I suck at this <em>so</em>&nbsp;much.</p>
<p>This morning my wife and I were talking about <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/jobs">a job posting</a> that the reliably awesome folks at <a href="http://www.ravelry.com/">Ravelry</a> have posted, and I said, &#8220;I kinda want to apply for&nbsp;that.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>You can&#8217;t,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a full time job.&#8221; (I already have a full time job, of&nbsp;course.)</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>I can&#8217;t do it full time, sure, but maybe I could do it full time during the Summer, and half time during the school&nbsp;year.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="dquo">&#8220;</span>Do you think you have twenty extra hours a week during the&nbsp;semester?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, until she said it like that, I did. I&#8217;m just <em>awful</em> both at judging how long things will take and at judging how much time I have to do&nbsp;the.</p>
<p>For this reason, in class, I try never to say things like &#8220;I will have X ready by Y,&#8221; because one or both of those problems will likely make me wrong. I will usually say &#8220;I <em>should</em> have X by Y,&#8221; which leaves me a little room to be&nbsp;wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Tackling things piecemeal.</em> Let&#8217;s say today is Monday, and I have 50 student papers that were just turned in, and I want them to be back in student hands by Friday. What a normal person would do is try to tackle 10 papers a day, so that by the end of the day Friday, they&#8217;re done. Yay!&nbsp;Reasonable.</p>
<p>I will probably not do this. Instead, I will try to orchestrate things so that I have an enormous block of time so that I can do them all at once. This may or may not work, and because it&#8217;s harder to get ten hours or so at a block than it is to get two hours together five times, it&#8217;ll likely end up meaning that I don&#8217;t accomplish things according to my own&nbsp;deadline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Prioritizing.</em> Broadly speaking, I have no idea what is important and what is not. If I have five tasks I need to complete, I have a lot of trouble deciding which I should approach first, even if one of them is &#8220;exit the burning building.&#8221;<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Being mean.</em> This is a tough one. As a teacher, sometimes it&#8217;s my job to be mean. I&#8217;m good at that when it matters. If you need to fail my class, you need to fail my class&#8212;and while that sucks for everybody, you&#8217;re not going to be able to sweet-talk me out of&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>The times when I suck at being mean, though, are the little times. I set out my policies pretty clearly on my Syllabi, and I hold to those policies pretty clearly. So when someone comes to me and says, for example, &#8220;I need to leave 45 minutes early today,&#8221; I&#8217;ll likely say &#8220;Okay,&#8221; and mean&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that what the student hears is something like, &#8220;Oh, of course visiting your out-of-state stylist for an elaborate purple up-do is more important than my class; by all means, come and go as you please and expect no consequences whatsoever.!&#8221; When what I mean is &#8220;Okay, that&#8217;s your choice; as per the Syllabus, I&#8217;ll be marking you absent.&nbsp;Ta!&#8221;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My intention is to both include this on my Syllabi next semester&#8212;or at least, include a link to the relevant page&#8212;and to use this list to help me design my courses, such that I can build my practices and policies <em>around</em> my limitations, with the hope that I can thereby avoid&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll see how it&nbsp;goes.</p>

<p>Both in terms of its role on my Syllabus and its role in my life, I recognize that this should probably be paired with a corresponding list of Things I&#8217;m Pretty Good At, but at the moment, I&#8217;m wanting to work on some of those limitations, so this is coming first.&#160;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
