    <h1>Publication Note</h1>
    <p>The following &#8220;review&#8221; was originally written for <a href="https://killscreen.com/articles/review-fallout-new-vegas-add-ons/">Kill Screen</a>, but both the magazine and the review itself are long since dead. The semantic toys with which I am playing here require the use of a fixed line-length, which may mean this does not look pretty on mobile. Landscape is better. <em>Mea&nbsp;culpa.</em></p>

<div class='solid'>
           You understand, in fact, that the game is <em>not</em> your <br />
     story. It is the story of Christine, of Elijah, of Veronica, of <br />
     Ulysses, of Joshua Graham, of Caesar, of ED-E, of the Big MT, <br />
     and of the Courier Six who lived before Benny&#8217;s bullet dropped <br />
     you into her vacant mind. In bits and pieces throughout the DLC,<br />
     you see these people dance around each other, darting in and out<br />
     of each others&#8217; lives as they flit through your past and <br />
     present.  <br />
     <br />
          A man goes for a hike. His wife, Char, and his son, Alex, <br />
     stay home. As he drives back to them, he sees a flash of light,<br />
     and watches his world consumed in fire, and understands that <br />
     everything he knows is lost. Char is gone. Alex is gone. In the <br />
     blear of his grief, he stumbles into a cave, where scientists <br />
     have abandoned some food stores. For months, he weeps in that <br />
     cave, until it is safe for him to wander dizzily into his <br />
     incomprehensible new world. He sees one tribe take another <br />
     captive, and drives off the intruders with his meager store of <br />
     weapons. He finds a woman, Sylvie, caught in one of his traps.  <br />
     He cares for her wounds, and finds he cares for her, and soon <br />
     they are in love, and she is pregnant.  His life is meaningful <br />
     again. A wife. A son. Not replacements to the ones he lost, but <br />
     successors. When the time comes, his son&#8211;Michael&#8211;is born breech, <br />
     and does not survive. Sylvie, too, is lost. He begins to think <br />
     of ending his own life. Desperate for something to care for, he <br />
     finds a group of children in need of guidance, and from his <br />
     hideout in the caves he leads them from concealment, until they <br />
     believe he is a loving god. When he realizes his life is ending, <br />
     he seeks a place where they will not find his body, and he hides <br />
     himself there to wait for death.  On a hilltop overlooking a <br />
     river, he dies. For 157 years, he rests alone with his <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Sorrows">sorrows</a>.<br />
     <br />
          When you find his body, <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Survivalist%27s_rifle">his gun</a> becomes your gun.  His life <br />
     was his life. His story was his story. His rifle is a relic of <br />
     his loss, and a monument to a world that lived and died before <br />
     you were born, and that will live and die again when you are <br />
     gone, a world in which you do not mean enough to even have a <br />
     name. <br />
     <br />
          When he calls you to the Great Divide, Ulysses&#8211;the other<br />
     Courier, a man whose legend has haunted your travels&#8211;tells you<br />
     of a life you led before you were You, when the Courier <em>you</em><br />
     control had a mind of her own, and a name, and a history. He<br />
     tells you of a community you (or rather, <em>not-You</em>) built from<br />
     the ground to the sky, and how, with casual ease, you pummeled<br />
     it to ash. Ulysses is the only survivor of the life you don&#8217;t<br />
     remember, and the part of the story <em>you</em> control is, really,<br />
     just an epilogue. And when you, with casual ease, push a button<br />
     to open a door, and launch a nuclear missle at an unsuspecting<br />
     township, he reminds you that your story&#8211;Courier Six&#8217;s story,<br />
     America&#8217;s story, NCR&#8217;s story, the Legion&#8217;s story, the <em>Fallout</em><br />
     story&#8211;is not truly under your control. <br />
     <br />
          Christine is a story. Joshua Graham is a story. Elijah is a<br />
     story.  Veronica is a story. Ulysses is a story. Caesar is a<br />
     story. ED-E is a story. The Big MT is a story. America is a<br />
     story. You change each incidentally, as you pass by, and each<br />
     changes you, as it passes by. <br />
     <br />
          You kill a <a href="http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Marked_men">Marked Man</a>, or an NCR Ranger, and you don&#8217;t know<br />
     what game you&#8217;re ending&#8211;what narrative, what quest, that ranger<br />
     was on.  They are, of course, still the same mindless AI that <br />
     drives every other enemy in every other game. But what Ulysses<br />
     teaches you is that each of those creatures is not just a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_(computer_gaming)">mob</a>,<br />
     but a <em>character,</em> with a mother and a father, a home, a love, a life<br />
     that you will never see. Ulysses shows you that every choice you<br />
     make is full of hidden costs. He makes you realize that you <br />
     play other roles than &#8220;protagonist.&#8221; That there are<br />
     other ways of seeing. <br />
     <br />
          That this game&#8211;this world, this universe&#8211;was never about <br />
     <span class='grey'>you</span> at all.</div></pre></div></div>
