        <p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve shifted things around a&nbsp;bit. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to do this for some time, inasmuch as my old site&#8212;lovely as it was, to be sure&#8212;had a few key limitations,&nbsp;namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>being&nbsp;Wordpress</li>
<li>being exclusively&nbsp;gamery</li>
<li>being&nbsp;dated</li>
<li>being&nbsp;boring</li>
</ul>
<p>And so. Because I am a <a href="http://geekabouttown.com/categories/geek/">geek</a>, I have made things as complicated as I possibly can without having my wife kill&nbsp;me.</p>

        <p>It&#8217;s been a busy morning over at <a href="http://www.killscreendaily.com/"><i>Kill Screen</i></a>.<br />
</p>
<p>In the unlikely event that you read this blog but not that magazine, <a href="http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/infinity-blade">my review of <i>Infinity Blade</i></a> ran today.  It has gotten a <a href="https://twitter.com/#search?q=http%3A%2F%2Fkillscreendaily.com%2Farticles%2Freviews%2Finfinity-blade">not inconsiderable</a> amount of <a>attention.</a></p>
<p>Three cheers for <i>Kill Screen</i> for being awesome and making this&nbsp;possible.</p>

        <p>Recently, I was fascinated by <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/">Brainy Gamer Michael Abbot&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.brainygamer.com/the_brainy_gamer/2011/03/rollercoaster-bias.html">response</a> to
<em>Heavy Rain</em> designer David Cage&#8217;s talk at this year&#8217;s <span class="caps">GDC</span>. Unlike Abbott, I
did like <em>Heavy Rain</em>, although at times I found its interface maddening, and I
felt like there were a lot of untapped possibilities in the story. The game was
rich, though, in what I value about gaming, which I have talked about at length
elsewhere in other games: empathy, shared subjectivity, difficult non-binary
choices, moral and ethical ambiguity, and&nbsp;origami.</p>

        <p>Recently, I had a conversation with <a href="http://www.espermansion.com/">Ryan Kuo</a> of <a href="http://www.killscreenmagazine.com"><i>Kill Screen</i></a> on the question of whether or not it made sense for <i><span class="caps">KS</span></i> to review games that are less than timely.  Would it make sense, for instance, to review something like <i>Angry Birds</i>?  The game has been around a while, and is hugely popular, but it&#8217;s easy to see why a review would be less than fruitful.  Everybody already knows what <i>Angry Birds</i> is, and whether it&#8217;s worth&nbsp;buying.</p>

        <p>The holidays have taken me away from the blog, but there is good news to be had: I&#8217;ve started doing some work for <i><a href="http://www.killscreenmagazine.com" target="_blank">Kill Screen</a></i> online.  I&#8217;ll post here when my pieces go up there.  The new website looks great, and I&#8217;m excited to be involved with it.  My first piece, <a href="http://killscreenmagazine.com/articles/all-dressed-drakeskin" target="_blank">&#8220;Here I Am, All Dressed in Drakeskin&#8221;</a> may look familiar to readers of this blog, but the next one will be brand new.

        <p>I have made several attempts at writing this post; this is the first I have deemed an adequate answer&#8212;or a beginning to an answer&#8212;for the question.  As a dog returneth to his vomit, so I return to this&nbsp;question.*</p>
<p>Sometimes&#8212;when I get rejected by a mainstream journal with a note like, &#8220;Loved the essay, too much video game stuff,&#8221; for instance&#8212;I see myself through the eyes of my non-gamer readers.  I see a competent writer who, for reasons incomprehensible, devotes himself to writing about a hobby that is immature at best and an active waste of time and talent at worst.  They likely see it as uninteresting or irrelevant to the interests of readers who are not gamers, and I can empathize.  I imagine some readers of this blog, too, sometimes ask the damnable question I ask my students all the time: <em>why is this worth writing&nbsp;about?</em></p>

        <p>Anhedonia is one of my favorite words.  It&#8217;s a symptom of depression,
generally speaking, but it&#8217;s such an elegant word for such a specific concept
that I can&#8217;t help but love it.  Anhedonia: the death of pleasure.  It
describes the feeling of no longer enjoying something you once enjoyed.  This
is how I feel about <em>Crackdown&nbsp;2.</em></p>

        <p>I have been playing Fable <span class="caps">III</span>, lately, and I really can&#8217;t get over how
extremely short the game seems to fall of its goals, at least as expressed by
<a href="http://www.bit-tech.net/gaming/xbox-360/2010/03/23/peter-molyneux-fable-3-and-emotional-games/3">this interview with Bit-Tech</a> (discovered, and post in part prompted, via

<em>Fable <span class="caps">III</span></em>, Peter Molyneux wants us to feel loved.&#8221;  The game is supposed to
be about connection, about relationships, about choices that affect our
ability to live in the world of Albion, and most of all about people.  But
whether ﻿because of technical floppery or design misunderstanding, the very
attempts the game makes to be personable for me make it&nbsp;emotionless.</p>

        <p>I feel compelled to comment on this <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beatonna/status/28848973254">series</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beatonna/status/28848979918">of</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/beatonna/status/28848985491">tweets</a> from Kate
Beaton (utterly fantastic <a href="http://www.harkavagrant.com/">webcomic</a> artist and one of my favorite
<a href="http://www.twitter.com/beatonna/">tweeters</a>), and on <a href="http://regreteverything.tumblr.com/post/1412408265">this tumbld response</a> from a reader,  because I
think I feel like the latter is missing a key point about feminism that is
worth elaborating on.  It&#8217;s something that&#8217;s easy to forget when thinking
about feminism, and even when thinking as an aspiring feminist: even if men
and women are equal in every form of capability, men and women are not the
same, because they have different&nbsp;histories.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2010/10/lead_industry_lawyer_lays_out.php">This post</a> over at <a href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/">GameSetWatch</a> lays out some of the basic arguments we
can expect to hear from the <a href="http://www.entmerch.org/"><span class="caps">EMA</span></a> side of the table (i.e., in context, the
good guys). One of the &#8220;vagueness problems&#8221; Smith mentions is that the law in
question &#8220;limits restrictions to games that &#8216;as a whole &#8230; lack serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for&nbsp;minors.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an epic assertion. Count &#8216;em, folks: there are four good reasons for a
videogame. <a href="http://jnicholasgeist.com/2010/07/08/art-and-attempt/">As I&#8217;ve blogged before</a>, there&#8217;s not even uniform agreement as to
whether games are capable of being artistic or literary, though my own views on
the matter are more certain. To me, the problem extends well beyond
&#8220;vagueness.&#8221; Questions about &#8220;art&#8221; and gaming run into the same problems that
all questions about &#8220;art&#8221; do&#8212;problems of canon, which are problems of audience,
which are problems of race and&nbsp;class.</p>

        <p>There exists some question as to <a href="http://finallyfeminism101.wordpress.com/2007/03/19/faq-can-men-be-feminists/">whether or not I can be a feminist</a>, so prior to writing this post I had the following conversation via GChat with my wife (who definitely is&nbsp;one):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>me:</strong> Do you think I&#8217;m a feminist?<br />
(No wrong answer here, and feel free to not answer.  Just have it on the&nbsp;brain.)</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> Yes.<br />
Not a hard&nbsp;question.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which I guess means it&#8217;s okay for me to comment on <a href="http://www.utne.com/science-technology/feminist-video-game-Hey-Baby.aspx">this post</a> about the new game <em><a href="http://www.heybabygame.com">Hey Baby</a></em>.  The game&#8217;s premise is simple: wander around the city being harassed by male hecklers, jeerers, catcallers, and wolf-whistlers, and then kill them all.  My first reaction&#8212;for which you may be justified in stabbing me in the eyeballs&#8212;has more or less held since watching the trailer: they should really be marketing this to&nbsp;men.</p>

        <p>Working with the tutors at the <a href="http://writingcenter.cos.edu/" target="_blank">Writing Center I coordinate </a>this week, we came across the perpetual and exhausting question of what to do about student writers who come to us for help, but then immediately get defensive of their writing.  I&#8217;ve worked with a lot of these students myself, both as a tutor and in workshop.  We talked about the issue as a tutorial problem&#8212;how do we facilitate a productive session in that context?&#8212;but since then, I&#8217;ve started thinking about it from a writerly perspective.  What do I do when I realize that <em>I am that&nbsp;writer?</em> </p>
