        <p>Let me finally add that these calculations leave out the moral and emotional aspects of this process. Certainly, we can reduce microwaving to a question of mere efficiency, but this loses all of the complicated nuance of the task. How does one account for the feeling of pride one gets with a careful, accurate estimation? How does one factor in the way the food tastes just a little bit better knowing that its perfect temperature is the result of my own insight and forethought, rather than haphazard button-slapping? How too the knowledge that those who share the microwave with me will feel my respect and admiration manifested in a clean&nbsp;timer?</p>            <footer>

<p>From time to time I get emails or twitter mentions from other people who also thought some of my web experiments at <em><a href="https://killscreen.com/author/j-nicholas-geist/">Kill Screen</a></em> were neat, and wondering where they are. So (with <em><span class="caps">KS</span></em>&#8216;s permission) I&#8217;m republishing <a href="/oddities/">some of those oddities here</a>. The first of them is one of my favorite things I&#8217;ve ever written, my review of <a href="/oddities/infinity-blade/"><em>Infinity Blade</em></a>. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s back up&nbsp;somewhere.</p>

        <p>I was listening to a <a href="http://www.maximumfun.org/bullseye/judge-john-hodgman-episode-151-sic-semper-dramatis">not-very-recent episode of <em>Judge John Hodgman</em></a> recently where Judge Hodgman, Bailiff Jesse, and an unspeakably fabulous man debated the equivalence of reading and listening to audiobooks, and ever since I&#8217;ve been paying much more attention to the different dynamics of the experiences. Having just made it through Spring Break, and as a regular commuter, I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of both, and my feeling&#8212;somewhat surprisingly&#8212;is that Judge Hodgman was right: they are &#8220;separate but equal&#8221; experiences. A book and its audiobook offer two fundamentally different ways to experience the story they&nbsp;describe.</p>            <footer>

        <p>As a teacher, I <a href="http://inthecourseofmyduties.tumblr.com">comment</a> on a <em>lot</em> of student writing. I usually do this digitally, as my handwriting is so awful as to make doctors weep. And, because students in the same classes tend to be learning the same things at the same time, I often find myself needing to say the same thing over and over, to lots of students in lots of different&nbsp;classes. </p>
<p>Since I need to be able to inject these comments quickly, easily, and repeatedly, I&#8217;ve been trying to find a good way to automate them for some time now. In my last attempt, I&#8217;ve figured out a pretty good way to do thisâ€”solving a long-standing problem I&#8217;ve had with Keyboard Maestro in the&nbsp;process.</p>            <footer>

        <p>I <a href="/categories/geek">fiddle around with a lot of things.</a>  It&#8217;s in my nature. I began listing my recent forays into configuring email as an example, and I realized quite quickly that the odyssey ought to be its own post. The reason I do this sort of fiddling, though, almost always composed of two intertwining mental&nbsp;phenomena:</p>
<ol>
<li>I know what I need,&nbsp;and</li>
<li>I know the limitations of the thing I&#8217;m fiddling&nbsp;with.</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes, when we&#8217;re talking about software or something similar, I know up front what the limitations are; often, though, I only find out by playing around with it. Likewise, I often know what I need up front; other times, though, I only find out what I need by finding out where my needs rub up against the limitations of whatever it is I&#8217;m trying to work&nbsp;with.</p>
<p>As I was listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/71">Back to Work 71</a>, I started thinking about the problems that exist in organizations&#8212;things like the <a href="http://passiveaggressivenotes.com/">passive aggression</a> that Merlin and Dan were discussing&#8212;as functions of that same pair of forces. More specifically, it made me think about the problems I have as a teacher with my students, the problems my students have with me as a teacher, and perhaps most importantly, the problems I have with myself as a teacher.  All these problems&#8212;and perhaps all problems&#8212;come down to a conflict between one party&#8217;s expectations and another party&#8217;s&nbsp;limitations.</p>            <footer>

        <p>As you can see, I&#8217;ve shifted things around a&nbsp;bit. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been wanting to do this for some time, inasmuch as my old site&#8212;lovely as it was, to be sure&#8212;had a few key limitations,&nbsp;namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>being&nbsp;Wordpress</li>
<li>being exclusively&nbsp;gamery</li>
<li>being&nbsp;dated</li>
<li>being&nbsp;boring</li>
</ul>
<p>And so. Because I am a <a href="http://geekabouttown.com/categories/geek/">geek</a>, I have made things as complicated as I possibly can without having my wife kill&nbsp;me.</p>            <footer>

        <p>Recently, I had a conversation with <a href="http://www.espermansion.com/">Ryan Kuo</a> of <a href="http://www.killscreenmagazine.com"><i>Kill Screen</i></a> on the question of whether or not it made sense for <i><span class="caps">KS</span></i> to review games that are less than timely.  Would it make sense, for instance, to review something like <i>Angry Birds</i>?  The game has been around a while, and is hugely popular, but it&#8217;s easy to see why a review would be less than fruitful.  Everybody already knows what <i>Angry Birds</i> is, and whether it&#8217;s worth&nbsp;buying.</p>            <footer>

can expect to hear from the <a href="http://www.entmerch.org/"><span class="caps">EMA</span></a> side of the table (i.e., in context, the
good guys). One of the &#8220;vagueness problems&#8221; Smith mentions is that the law in
question &#8220;limits restrictions to games that &#8216;as a whole &#8230; lack serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for&nbsp;minors.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is an epic assertion. Count &#8216;em, folks: there are four good reasons for a
videogame. <a href="http://jnicholasgeist.com/2010/07/08/art-and-attempt/">As I&#8217;ve blogged before</a>, there&#8217;s not even uniform agreement as to
whether games are capable of being artistic or literary, though my own views on
the matter are more certain. To me, the problem extends well beyond
&#8220;vagueness.&#8221; Questions about &#8220;art&#8221; and gaming run into the same problems that
all questions about &#8220;art&#8221; do&#8212;problems of canon, which are problems of audience,
which are problems of race and&nbsp;class.</p>            <footer>

        <p>Last night, after Megan went to sleep, I sat down on the couch.  <em>Final Fantasy <span class="caps">XIII</span></em> in the <span class="caps">PS3</span>, for better or for worse.Â³  Wireless keyboard and mouse in front of me, on the coffee table.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Harmony-550-Universal-Remote/dp/B000EUGX70/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1282000361&amp;sr=8-1">Harmony</a> beside me.  Sixaxis in hand.  This (I swear to you) is the problem I had: I wanted to play <em><span class="caps">FFXIII</span> </em>while using a Linux live <span class="caps">CD</span> to resize the ext3 partition on a hard drive in the Hackintosh hooked up to my <span class="caps">TV</span> (to make room for an <span class="caps">HFS</span>+ partition, of course), but I was frustrated because I couldn&#8217;t set up picture-in-picture on my Harmony, and I was too lazy to get up and walk across the room to get my <span class="caps">TV</span>&nbsp;remote.</p>
<p>This pretty much sums up my whole&nbsp;self.  </p>            <footer>
